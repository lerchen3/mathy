Question,Solution
Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers such that $ab = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{4}$. Find all possible values of $\left| \frac{a^2 - b^2}{a^2 + b^2} \right|$.,"The hypothesis statement is equivalent to $a^2 + b^2 = 4ab$. Multiplying equations 1 and 2, we have $(a+b)^2 = 6ab$ and $(a-b)^2 = 2ab$. Since the left hand side and $ab$ are both positive, $\left| a^2 - b^2 \right| = \sqrt{12(ab)^2} = \sqrt{12ab}$. Then $\left| \frac{a^2 - b^2}{a^2 + b^2} \right| = \frac{\sqrt{12ab}}{4ab} = \frac{\sqrt{12}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. (It is clear that such $a$ and $b$ exist: quadratic formula.) For example, we can take $a=1$ and solve for $b$."
"A cafe has 3 tables and 5 individual counter seats. People enter in groups of size between 1 and 4, inclusive, and groups never share a table. A group of more than 1 will always try to sit at a table, but will sit in counter seats if no tables are available. Conversely, a group of 1 will always try to sit at the counter first. One morning, $M$ groups consisting of a total of $N$ people enter and sit down. Then, a single person walks in, and realizes that all the tables and counter seats are occupied by some person or group. What is the minimum possible value of $M + N$?","Consider the point right before the last table is occupied. We have two cases: first suppose there exists at least one open counter seat. Then, every table must contribute at least 3 to the value of $M+N$, because no groups of 1 will have taken a table with one of the counter seats open. By the end, the counter must contribute at least $5+2=7$ to $M+N$, as there must be at least two groups sitting at the counter. It follows that $M+N \ge 16$. For the second case, assume the counter is full right before the last table is taken. Then, everybody sitting at the counter must have entered as a singleton, since they entered when a table was still available. Consequently, the counter must contribute 10 to $M+N$, and each table contributes at least 2, so once again $M+N \ge 16$. We first show that $M+N \ge 16$. Now, $M+N = 16$ is achievable with eight groups of one, who first fill the counter seats, then the three tables. Thus, our answer is 16."
Let $ABC$ be a triangle with circumcenter $O$ such that $AC = 7$. Suppose that the circumcircle of $AOC$ is tangent to $BC$ at $C$ and intersects the line $AB$ at $A$ and $F$. Let $FO$ intersect $BC$ at $E$. Compute $BE$.,"O is the circumcenter of $\triangle AOC$, $\angle OCA = \angle OAC$. Because $AC$ is an inscribed arc of circumcircle to circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$, $\angle OCA = \angle OFA$. Furthermore, $BC$ is tangent to circumcircle of $\triangle AOC$, so $\angle OAC = \angle OCB$. However, again using the fact that $O$ is the circumcenter of $\triangle ABC$, $\angle OCB = \angle OBC$. We now have that $CO$ bisects $\angle ACB$, so it follows that $CA = CB$. Also, by AA similarity $\triangle EBF \sim \triangle ABC$, so we have $EB = BC/2 = AC/2 = 7/2.$"
"Let $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5$ be real numbers whose sum is 20. Determine with proof the smallest possible value of $\sum_{1 \le i < j \le 5} \lfloor a_i + a_j \rfloor$.","We claim that the minimum is 72. This can be achieved by taking $a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = a_4 = 0.4$ and $a_5 = 18.4$. To prove that this is optimal, note that $\sum_{1 \le i < j \le 5} \lfloor a_i + a_j \rfloor = \sum_{1 \le i < j \le 5} (a_i + a_j) - \sum_{1 \le i < j \le 5} \{a_i + a_j\} = 80 - \sum_{1 \le i < j \le 5} \{a_i + a_j\}$, so it suffices to maximize $\sum_{1 \le i < j \le 5} \{a_i + a_j\}$. Taking each sum modulo 1, it is clear that both are integers. Thus, the above sum is at most $2 \cdot 4 = 8$, and our original expression is at least $80 - 8 = 72$, completing the proof."
"Let triangle $ABC$ satisfy $2BC = AB + AC$ and have incenter $I$ and circumcircle $\omega$. Let $D$ be the intersection of $AI$ and $\omega$ (with $A$, $D$ distinct). Prove that $I$ is the midpoint of $AD$.","Since $AD$ is an angle bisector, $D$ is the midpoint of arc $BC$ opposite $A$ on $\omega$. It is well-known that $B$, $I$, and $C$ lie on a circle centered at $D$. Thus $BD = DC = DI$. Applying Ptolemy’s theorem to cyclic quadrilateral $ABDC$, we get $AB \cdot DC + AC \cdot BD = AD \cdot BC = AD \cdot (AB + AC)/2$. Using $BD = DC$ we have immediately that $AD = 2BD = 2DI$ so $I$ is the midpoint of $AD$ as desired."
"If Maya draws two cards with replacement from a standard 52-card deck, what is the probability that the two cards have the same suit or the same number, but not both?","Let $S$ be the event that the two cards have the same suit, and $N$ be the event that the two cards have the same number. We want to find $P(S \cup N) - P(S \cap N)$. $P(S) = \frac{13}{52} \times \frac{12}{52} = \frac{3}{52}$. $P(N) = \frac{4}{52} \times \frac{3}{52} = \frac{3}{52}$. $P(S \cap N) = 0$. Thus $P(S \cup N) = \frac{13}{52} \times \frac{12}{52} + \frac{4}{52} \times \frac{3}{52} = \frac{156}{2704} = \frac{13}{221}$"
"If Alex has a 50% chance of singing on Sunday, and a 70% chance of singing on Sunday if she does not sing on Saturday, and she never sings on both days, find the probability that she sings on Saturday.","Let $p$ be the probability that Alex sings on Saturday. Then the probability that she sings on Sunday is $0.7(1-p)$. We are given that the probability that she sings on Sunday is 0.5. Therefore, $0.7(1-p) = 0.5$, which gives $1-p = \frac{5}{7}$, so $p = \frac{2}{7}$."
"How many orderings $(a_1, \dots, a_8)$ of $(1, 2, \dots, 8)$ exist such that $a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 + a_5 - a_6 + a_7 - a_8 = 0$?","Let $S_1 = a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7$ and $S_2 = a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + a_8$. Then $S_1 = S_2$ and $S_1 + S_2 = 1+2+\dots+8 = 36$, so $S_1 = S_2 = 18$. We must choose 4 numbers from $\{1, \dots, 8\}$ that sum to 18. The possible sets are $\{1, 2, 7, 8\}$, $\{1, 3, 6, 8\}$, $\{1, 4, 5, 8\}$, $\{1, 4, 6, 7\}$. There are 4 such sets. For each set, there are $4! \times 4!$ ways to arrange the numbers. Thus, there are $4 \times 2 \times 4! \times 4! = 4608$ such orderings."
"Values $a_1, \dots, a_{2013}$ are chosen independently and at random from the set $\{1, \dots, 2013\}$. What is the expected number of distinct values in the set $\{a_1, \dots, a_{2013}\}$?","Let $X_n = 1$ if $n$ appears in $\{a_1, \dots, a_{2013}\}$ and $0$ otherwise. Then $E[X_n] = P(n \text{ appears}) = 1 - \left(\frac{2012}{2013}\right)^{2013}$. The expected number of distinct values is $E[\sum_{n=1}^{2013} X_n] = \sum_{n=1}^{2013} E[X_n] = 2013 \left( 1 - \left(\frac{2012}{2013}\right)^{2013} \right) \approx 2013(1 - e^{-1}) \approx 1342.5$"
"A single-elimination ping-pong tournament has $2^{2013}$ players, seeded in order of ability. If the player with seed $x$ plays the player with seed $y$, then it is possible for $x$ to win if and only if $x \le y+3$. For how many players $P$ is it possible for $P$ to win?","Let $n$ be the highest seed that can win. The winner must beat at most 3 players in each round. To maximize $n$, we consider the case where 1 loses to 4, 4 loses to 7, etc. The highest seed that can reach the semi-finals is $3 \times 2^{2011} + 1 = 6034$. To reach the final, it must beat the other semi-finalist. The highest seed that can win is $6034 + 4 = 6038$. Thus, there are 6038 players for whom it is possible to win."
"Let ABCD be an isosceles trapezoid such that AD = BC, AB = 3, and CD = 8. Let E be a point in the plane such that BC = EC and AE $\perp$ EC. Compute AE.","Let r = BC = EC = AD.  In $\triangle ACE$, $\angle AEC$ is a right angle, so by the Pythagorean Theorem, AE$^2$ = AC$^2$ - r$^2$. Let the height of $\triangle ACD$ at A intersect DC at F.  Then, by the Pythagorean Theorem, AC$^2$ = FC$^2$ + AF$^2$.  After some calculations (using the properties of the trapezoid), we find AE$^2 = 24$, so AE = $2\sqrt{6}$."
"Let $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ be circles with centers O$_1$ and O$_2$, respectively, and radii r$_1$ and r$_2$, respectively. Suppose that O$_2$ is on $\omega_1$. Let A be one of the intersections of $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$, and B be one of the two intersections of line O$_1$O$_2$ with $\omega_2$. If AB = O$_1$A, find all possible values of $\frac{r_1}{r_2}$.","There are two cases.  In Case 1, we consider $\triangle ABO_2$. Since AB = AO$_1$ = O$_1$O$_2$ = r$_1$ and O$_2$B = O$_2$A = r$_2$, we have $\triangle ABO_1 \sim \triangle O_2AB$.  Solving the resulting equation, we find $\frac{r_1}{r_2} = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$. In Case 2, a similar analysis, considering $\triangle ABO_1$, yields the same result: $\frac{r_1}{r_2} = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$."
"In triangle ABC, $\angle A = 45^\circ$ and M is the midpoint of BC. AM intersects the circumcircle of ABC for the second time at D, and AM = 2MD. Find cos $\angle AOD$, where O is the circumcenter of ABC.","Since $\angle BAC = 45^\circ$, $\angle BOC = 90^\circ$. Let r be the circumradius. Then BC = $\sqrt{2}r$, BM = CM = $\frac{\sqrt{2}r}{2}$. By Power of a Point, BM $\cdot$ CM = AM $\cdot$ DM, so AM = r and DM = $\frac{r}{2}$. Using the Law of Cosines on $\triangle AOD$, we have cos $\angle AOD = -\frac{1}{8}$."
"Arpon chooses a positive real number $k$. For each positive integer $n$, he places a marker at the point $(n, nk)$ in the $(x, y)$ plane. Suppose that two markers whose $x$ coordinates differ by 4 have distance 31. What is the distance between the markers at $(7, 7k)$ and $(19, 19k)$?","The difference of the $x$-coordinates of the markers is $12 = 3 \cdot 4$. Thus, by similar triangles (where we draw right triangles whose legs are parallel to the axes and whose hypotenuses lie along the line $y = kx$), the distance between the markers is $3 \cdot 31 = 93$."
"The real numbers $x, y, z$ satisfy $0 \le x \le y \le z \le 4$. If their squares form an arithmetic progression with common difference 2, determine the minimum possible value of $|z^2 - x^2|$.","Let the squares form an arithmetic progression with common difference 2. Then $y^2 - x^2 = 2$ and $z^2 - y^2 = 2$. Thus $z^2 - x^2 = 4$.  We have $y^2 = x^2 + 2$ and $z^2 = x^2 + 4$. Since $x \le y \le z \le 4$, we have $x \le \sqrt{2}$ and $x \le \sqrt{12}$. The minimum occurs when $x = 0$, which gives $y = \sqrt{2}$ and $z = 2$. The minimum value of $|z^2 - x^2|$ is 4."
"Rahul has ten cards face-down, which consist of five distinct pairs of matching cards. During each move of his game, Rahul chooses one card to turn face-up, looks at it, and then chooses another to turn face-up and looks at it. If the two face-up cards match, the game ends. If not, Rahul flips both cards face-down and keeps repeating this process. Initially, Rahul doesn’t know which cards are which. Assuming that he has perfect memory, find the smallest number of moves after which he can guarantee that the game has ended.","Label the 10 cards $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_5, b_1, b_2, \dots, b_5$ such that $a_i$ and $b_i$ match for $1 \le i \le 5$. Rahul cannot always end the game in less than 4 moves. However, Rahul can always end the game in 4 moves. To do this, he can turn over 6 distinct cards in his first 3 moves. If we consider the 5 sets of cards $\{a_1, b_1\}, \{a_2, b_2\}, \{a_3, b_3\}, \{a_4, b_4\}, \{a_5, b_5\}$, then by the pigeonhole principle, at least 2 of the 6 revealed cards must be from the same set. Rahul can then turn over those 2 cards on the fourth move, ending the game."
"Sherry and Val are playing a game. Sherry has a deck containing 2011 red cards and 2012 black cards, shuffled randomly. Sherry flips these cards over one at a time, and before she flips each card over, Val guesses whether it is red or black. If Val guesses correctly, she wins 1 dollar; otherwise, she loses 1 dollar. In addition, Val must guess red exactly 2011 times. If Val plays optimally, what is her expected profit from this game?","Let $f(r, b, g)$ be the expected profit when there are $r$ red cards, $b$ black cards, and $g$ guesses must be red. We will prove by induction on $r + b$ that $f(r, b, g) = \frac{(b - r) + 2(r - g)}{(r + b)}$.  If Val guesses red, her expected profit is $\frac{r}{r + b}(1 + f(r - 1, b, g - 1)) + \frac{b}{r + b}(-1 + f(r, b - 1, g)) = \frac{(b - r) + 2(r - g)}{(r + b)}$. Similarly, if she guesses black, her expected profit is $\frac{r}{r + b}(-1 + f(r - 1, b, g)) + \frac{b}{r + b}(1 + f(r, b - 1, g)) = \frac{(b - r) + 2(r - g)}{(r + b)}$. Plugging in $r = 2011$, $b = 2012$, $g = 2011$ gives an expected profit of $\frac{1}{4023}$."

Let Z be on segment AB such that AX, BY, and DZ are concurrent. Determine the area of triangle XYZ.","Let AX and BD meet at P. We have DP/PB = DX/AB = 3/4. Applying Ceva’s Theorem in $\triangle ABD$, we have $\frac{AZ}{ZB} \cdot \frac{BX}{XD} \cdot \frac{DY}{YA} = 1$, so $\frac{AZ}{ZB} = \frac{DY}{YA} \cdot \frac{XD}{XB} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{8}$.  $[AYZ] = \frac{1}{22}[ABCD]$, $[DYX] = \frac{1}{4}[ABCD]$, $[XCBZ] = \frac{43}{88}[ABCD]$.

Find the product of all possible values of $z_1$.","Let $z_n = r_n e^{i\theta_n}$.  Since $|z_n| = 1$, $r_n = 1$.  $z_{n+3} / z_n^2 = 2$, which means $z_{n+3} = 2 z_n^2$. Since $|z_n| = 1$, this implies $\theta_{n+3} = 2\theta_n \pmod{2\pi}$. Then $\theta_n = k \pi /5$ for some integer $k$. Then $z_1^{10} = 1$, but $z_1 \ne 1$. The product of the roots is 65536."
"Triangle ABC has perimeter 1. Its three altitudes form the side lengths of a triangle. Find the set of all possible values of min(AB, BC, CA).","Let $a, b, c$ be the side lengths.

The triangle inequality on the altitudes gives $\frac{2K}{a} < \frac{2K}{b} + \frac{2K}{c}$.  $a + b + c = 1$. The set of possible values of $a$ is $(\frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}]$."
Let P be the number to partition 2013 into an ordered tuple of prime numbers? What is $\log_2(P)$?,"We use the following facts and heuristics. (1) The ordered partitions of n into any positive integers (not just primes) is $2^n$ by checking small cases and finding a pattern, and is not difficult to prove. (2) The partitions of 2013 into any positive integers equals the partitions of 2013 into integers from the set n, 2n, 3n, { . · · · }. (3) The small numbers matter more when considering partitions. (4) The set of primes is close in size (near the small numbers) to 2, 3, 5, 7, { · · · } or 2, 4, 6, { · · · } or 3, 6, 9, { · · · }. (5) The prime numbers get very sparse compared to the above two sets in the larger numbers. Thus, using these heuristics, the number of partitions of 2013 into primes is approximately $2^{2013/3}$ or $2^{2013/6}$, which, taking logarithms, give 670 and 1005.5, respectively. By (5), we should estimate $2^{2013/6}$."
"Let $O_1$ and $O_2$ be concentric circles with radii 4 and 6, respectively. A chord AB is drawn in $O_1$ with length 2. Extend AB to intersect $O_2$ in points C and D. Find CD.","Let O be the common center of $O_1$ and $O_2$, and let M be the midpoint of AB. Then $OM \perp AB$, so by the Pythagorean Theorem, $OM = \sqrt{4^2 - 1^2} = \sqrt{15}$. Thus $CM = \sqrt{6^2 - \sqrt{15}^2} = \sqrt{36-15} = \sqrt{21}$. Therefore, $CD = 2CM = 2\sqrt{21}$."
"Point P and line $\ell$ are such that the distance from P to $\ell$ is 12.

Then $OM \perp PT$ and $OM = PQ = 12$. Also, $PM = \frac{PT}{2} = \frac{13}{2}$. In right $\triangle OMP$, we have $OP^2 = OM^2 + PM^2 = 12^2 + (\frac{13}{2})^2 = 144 + \frac{169}{4} = \frac{725}{4}$. Therefore, $OP = \frac{\sqrt{725}}{2} = \frac{5\sqrt{29}}{2}$.

Note that $\angle DCB\' = \angle BCD = 70^\circ$, so $\angle ACD = \angle ACB\' - \angle DCB\' = 98^\circ - 70^\circ = 28^\circ$."
"Let C be a circle in the xy plane with radius 1 and center (0, 0, 0), and let P be a point in space with coordinates (3, 4, 8). Find the largest possible radius of a sphere that is contained entirely in the slanted cone with base C and vertex P.","Consider the plane passing through P that is perpendicular to the plane of the circle. The intersection of the plane with the cone and sphere is a cross section consisting of a circle inscribed in a triangle with a vertex P. The other two vertices of the triangle are the points of intersection between the plane and the unit circle. The distance from P to the origin is $\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 8^2} = \sqrt{89}$. The distance from P to the xy-plane is 8. The radius of the inscribed circle is given by $r = \frac{2A}{s}$, where A is the area and s is the semiperimeter. It can be shown that $r = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2}$."
"In quadrilateral ABCD, we have AB = 5, BC = 6, CD = 5, DA = 4, and $\angle ABC = 90^\circ$. Let AC and BD meet at E. Compute $\frac{BE}{ED}$.","We have $AC = \sqrt{5^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{61}$. Applying the Law of Cosines to $\triangle ACD$, we have $AC^2 = AD^2 + CD^2 - 2(AD)(CD)\cos(\angle ADC)$, so $61 = 16 + 25 - 40\cos(\angle ADC)$, which gives $\cos(\angle ADC) = -\frac{20}{40} = -\frac{1}{2}$. Thus $\angle ADC = 120^\circ$. The ratio $\frac{BE}{ED}$ is the ratio of the areas of $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ADC$, which is $\frac{\frac{1}{2}(5)(6)}{\frac{1}{2}(4)(5)\sin(120^\circ)} = \frac{30}{10(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})} = \frac{6}{\sqrt{3}} = 2\sqrt{3}$."

Find the length of AX.","Let R be the circumradius of $\triangle ABC$. Then $R = \frac{abc}{4K} = \frac{(13)(14)(15)}{4(84)} = \frac{65}{8}$. Since B\'B is a diameter, $\angle B\'AB = 90^\circ$. Also, $\triangle AMB\' \sim \triangle OMA$. Then $\frac{AX}{OM} = \frac{AB\'}{OB} = \frac{2R}{R} = 2$, so $AX = 2OM$. Since $OM \perp AB$, we have $OM = \sqrt{R^2 - (\frac{14}{2})^2} = \sqrt{(\frac{65}{8})^2 - 7^2} = \sqrt{\frac{4225 - 3136}{64}} = \frac{\sqrt{1089}}{8} = \frac{33}{8}$.

Compute the prime factorization of 159999.,"We have $159999 = 160000 - 1 = 20^4 - 1 = (20^2 - 1)(20^2 + 1) = (20 - 1)(20 + 1)(20^2 + 1) = 19 \cdot 21 \cdot 401 = 3 \cdot 7 \cdot 19 \cdot 401$. Therefore, the prime factorization is $\boxed{3 \cdot 7 \cdot 19 \cdot 401}$."
"Let $x_1, \dots, x_{100}$ be defined so that for each $i$, $x_i$ is a (uniformly) random integer between 1 and 6 inclusive. Find the expected number of integers in the set $\{x_1, x_1 + x_2, \dots, x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_{100}\}$ that are multiples of 6.","For any $i$, the probability that $x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_i$ is a multiple of 6 is $\frac{1}{6}$ because exactly 1 value out of 6 possible values of $x_i$ works. Because these 100 events are independent, the expected value is $100 \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{50}{3}$. Therefore, the expected number is $\boxed{\frac{50}{3}}$."
Let ABCDEF be a regular hexagon. Let P be the circle inscribed in $\triangle BDF$. Find the ratio of the area of circle P to the area of rectangle ABDE.,"Let the side length of the hexagon be $s$. The area of rectangle ABDE is $s^2 \sqrt{3}$. The length of BD is $s\sqrt{3}$, so the area of equilateral triangle BDF is $\frac{(s\sqrt{3})^2 \sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}s^2}{4}$. The inradius of an equilateral triangle is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{6}$ times the length of its side, and so has length $\frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Thus, the area of circle P is $\pi (\frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 = \frac{3\pi s^2}{4}$, so the ratio is $\frac{3\pi s^2/4}{s^2 \sqrt{3}} = \frac{3\pi}{4\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\pi \sqrt{3}}{4}$. Therefore, the ratio is $\boxed{\frac{\pi \sqrt{3}}{4}}$."

What is the probability that $d$ divides $z$?","As $100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2$, there are $3 \cdot 3 = 9$ divisors of 100. There are 900 possible pairs of $d$ and $z$. If $d$ is chosen, then there are $\frac{100}{d}$ possible values of $z$ such that $d$ divides $z$, so the total number of valid pairs of $d$ and $z$ is $\sum_{d|100} \frac{100}{d} = \sum_{d|100} d = (1 + 2 + 2^2)(1 + 5 + 5^2) = 7 \cdot 31 = 217$. The answer is therefore $\frac{217}{900}$. Therefore, the probability is $\boxed{\frac{217}{900}}$."
"If four fair six-sided dice are rolled, what is the probability that the lowest number appearing on any die is exactly 3?","The probability that all the die rolls are at least 3 is $(\frac{4}{6})^4$. The probability they are all at least 4 is $(\frac{3}{6})^4$. The probability of being in the former category but not the latter is thus $(\frac{4}{6})^4 - (\frac{3}{6})^4 = \frac{256 - 81}{1296} = \frac{175}{1296}$. Therefore, the probability is $\boxed{\frac{175}{1296}}$."
Find all integers $n$ for which $\frac{n^3 + 8}{n^2 - 4}$ is an integer.,"We have $\frac{n^3 + 8}{n^2 - 4} = \frac{(n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 4)}{(n + 2)(n - 2)} = \frac{n^2 - 2n + 4}{n - 2}$ for all $n \neq -2$. Then $\frac{n^2 - 2n + 4}{n - 2} = n + \frac{4}{n - 2}$ is an integer. This happens when $n - 2 = -4, -2, -1, 1, 2, 4$, corresponding to $n = -2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 6$, but we have $n \neq -2$ so the answers are 0, 1, 3, 4, 6. Therefore, the integers are $\boxed{0, 1, 3, 4, 6}$."
"The Evil League of Evil is plotting to poison the city’s water supply. They plan to set out from their headquarters at (5, 1) and put poison in two pipes, one along the line y = x and one along the line x = 7. What’s the shortest distance they can travel to visit both pipes and then return to their headquarters?","After they go to $y = x$, we reflect the remainder of their path in $y = x$, along with the second pipe and their headquarters. Now, they must go from (5, 1) to $x = 7$ crossing $y = x$, and then go to (1, 5). When they reach $x = 7$, we reflect the remainder of their path again, so now their reflected headquarters is at (1, 9). Thus, they just go from (5, 1) to (1, 9) in some path that inevitably crosses $y = x$ and $x = 7$. The shortest path they can take is a straight line with length $\sqrt{4^2 + 8^2} = \sqrt{80} = 4\sqrt{5}$. Therefore, the shortest distance is $\boxed{4\sqrt{5}}$."
"The numbers 20, 21, ..., 215, 216 = 65536 are written on a blackboard. You repeatedly take two numbers on the blackboard, subtract one from the other, erase them both, and write the result of the subtraction on the blackboard. What is the largest possible number that can remain on the blackboard when there is only one number left?","If we reverse the order of the numbers in the final subtraction we perform, then the final number will be negated. Thus, the possible final numbers come in pairs with opposite signs. Therefore, the largest possible number is the negative of the smallest possible number. To get the smallest possible number, clearly we can take the smallest number originally on the board and subtract all of the other numbers from it, so the smallest possible number is $20 - \sum_{k=1}^{16} 2^k = 20 - 65534 = -65514$, and thus the largest possible number is 65514.  However, the question states the numbers are 20, 21, ..., 216.  The sum is $\sum_{i=20}^{216} i = \sum_{i=1}^{216} i - \sum_{i=1}^{19} i = \frac{216(217)}{2} - \frac{19(20)}{2} = 23436 - 190 = 23246$.  The largest number is $\boxed{23246}$."
"Let $A = \{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_7\}$ be a set of distinct positive integers such that the mean of the elements of any nonempty subset of A is an integer. Find the smallest possible value of the sum of the elements in A.","For $2 \le i \le 6$, we claim that $a_1 \equiv \dots \equiv a_7 \pmod{i}$. This is because if we consider any $i-1$ of the 7 numbers, the other $7 - (i - 1) = 8 - i$ of them must all be equal modulo $i$, because we want the sum of all subsets of size $i$ to be a multiple of $i$. However, $8 - i \ge 2$, and this argument applies to any $8 - i$ of the 7 integers, so in fact all of them must be equal modulo $i$. We now have that all of the integers are equivalent modulo all of $2, \dots, 6$, so they are equivalent modulo 60, their least common multiple. Therefore, if the smallest integer is $k$, then the other 6 integers must be at least $k + 60, k + 60 \cdot 2, \dots, k + 60 \cdot 6$. This means the sum is $7k + 60 \cdot 21 \ge 7 + 60 \cdot 21 = 1267$. 1267 is achievable with $\{1, 1 + 60, \dots, 1 + 60 \cdot 6\}$, so it is the answer."

What is the maximum possible value of the sum $\sum_{i=1}^{20} \sum_{j=1}^{20} \min(a_i, b_j)$?","Let $x_k$, for $1 \le k \le 40$, be the number of integers $i$ with $1 \le i \le 20$ such that $a_i \ge k$. Let $y_k$, for $1 \le k \le 40$, be the number of integers $j$ with $1 \le j \le 20$ such that $b_j \ge k$. It follows from the problem statement that $x_k + y_k = 41 - k$. Note that if $1 \le i, j \le 20$, and $1 \le k \le 40$, then $\min(a_i, b_j) \ge k$ if and only if $a_i \ge k$ and $b_j \ge k$. So for a fixed $k$ with $1 \le k \le 40$, the number of pairs $(i, j)$ with $1 \le i, j \le 20$ such that $\min(a_i, b_j) \ge k$ is equal to $x_k y_k$. So we can rewrite $\sum_{i=1}^{20} \sum_{j=1}^{20} \min(a_i, b_j) = \sum_{k=1}^{40} x_k y_k$. Since $x_k + y_k = 41 - k$ for $1 \le k \le 40$, we have $x_k y_k \le \left( \frac{41 - k}{2} \right)^2$. So $\sum_{i=1}^{20} \sum_{j=1}^{20} \min(a_i, b_j) \le \sum_{k=1}^{40} \left( \frac{41 - k}{2} \right)^2 = 5530$. Equality holds when $(a_1, \dots, a_{20}) = (2, 4, \dots, 38, 40)$ and $(b_1, \dots, b_{20}) = (1, 3, \dots, 37, 39)$."

We have $f(0) = xyz = -7$, $f(1) = (x+1)(y+1)(z+1) = 7$, $f(2) = (x+2)(y+2)(z+2) = 4$.  We can use the method of finite differences.  Let $f(t) = at^3 + bt^2 + ct + d$. Then $f(0) = d = -7$, $f(1) = a+b+c-7 = 7$, $f(2) = 8a+4b+2c-7 = 4$. Solving this system of equations gives $a=1$, $b=-27/2$, $c=47/2$, $d=-7$. Thus $f(t) = t^3 - \frac{27}{2}t^2 + \frac{47}{2}t - 7$. Then $f(3) = 27 - \frac{27}{2}(9) + \frac{47}{2}(3) - 7 = 27 - \frac{243}{2} + \frac{141}{2} - 7 = -28$. Therefore, $(x+3)(y+3)(z+3) = -28$."

Now, the power of 5 in the denominator is $v_5(2015!) = 502$, and 5 does not divide any term in the numerator. Hence $a = -502$. Noting that $2015 = 31 \cdot 65$, we found that the numbers divisible by 31 in the numerator are those of the form $31 + 155k$ where $0 \le k \le 12$, including $31^2 = 961$; in the denominator they are of the form $155k$ where $1 \le k \le 13$.

First note that $g(2^n) = 1$, and that we can view $0, 1, \dots, 2^n - 1$ as $n$-digit binary sequences by appending leading zeros as necessary. (Then $g(0) = 0$.) Then for $0 \le x \le 2^n - 1$, $x$ and $2^n - x$ are complementary $n$-digit binary sequences (of 0’s and 1’s), with $x$’s strings of 1’s (0’s) corresponding to $2^n - x$’s strings of 0’s (resp. 1’s). It follows that $g(x) + g(2^n - x)$ is simply 1 more than the number of digit changes in $x$ (or $2^n - x$), i.e. the total number of 01 and 10 occurrences in $x$. Finally, because exactly half of all $n$-digit binary sequences have 0, 1 or 1, 0 at positions $k, k + 1$ (for $1 \le k \le n - 1$ fixed), we conclude that the average value of $g(x) + g(2^n - x)$ is $1 + \frac{n-1}{2}$, and thus that the total value of $g(x)$ is $\frac{2^n}{2}(1 + \frac{n-1}{2}) = 2^{n-2}(n+1)$, as desired."

The colors of the 11 even integers are independent of those of the odd integers because evens and odds are never exactly 2 apart. First, we count the number of ways to “color” the even integers. $f(0)$ can either be ‘green’ or ‘blue’. If $f(0)$ is ‘green’, then $f(2) = f(20) = \text{‘blue’}$. A valid coloring of the 8 other even integers corresponds bijectively to a string of 8 bits such that no two consecutive bits are 1. Therefore, the number of colorings of even integers in this case is $F_{10} = 55$. If $f(0)$ is ‘blue’, then a valid coloring of the 10 other even integers corresponds bijectively to a string as above, of 10 bits. The number of colorings for this case is $F_{12} = 144$. The total number of colorings of even integers is $55 + 144 = 199$.

Brahmagupta wishes to maximize $z$, so regardless of the value of $x$, he will pick $y = \frac{4x+3}{2}$. The expression for $z$ then simplifies to $- \frac{(4x+3)^2}{4} + 4x^2 + \frac{(4x+3)^2}{4} = 4x^2 + 6x + \frac{9}{4}$. Archimedes knows this and will therefore pick $x$ to minimize the above expression. By completing the square, we find that $x = -\frac{3}{8}$ minimizes $z$. Alternatively, note that $z$ is convex in $x$ and concave in $y$, so we can use the minimax theorem to switch the order of moves. If Archimedes goes second, he will set $x = \frac{y}{2}$ to minimize $z$, so Brahmagupta will maximize $-\frac{3}{4}$. Thus Archimedes should pick $x = -\frac{3}{8}$, as above."

"A wealthy king has his blacksmith fashion him a large cup, whose inside is a cone of height 9 inches and base diameter 6 inches (that is, the opening at the top of the cup is 6 inches in diameter). At one of his many feasts, he orders the mug to be ﬁlled to the brim with cranberry juice. For each positive integer $n$, the king stirs his drink vigorously and takes a sip such that the height of ﬂuid left in his cup after the sip goes down by $\frac{1}{n^2}$ inches. Shortly afterwards, while the king is distracted, the court jester adds pure Soylent to the cup until it’s once again full. The king takes sips precisely every minute, and his ﬁrst sip is exactly one minute after the feast begins. As time progresses, the amount of juice consumed by the king (in cubic inches) approaches a number $r$. Find $r$.","First, we ﬁnd the total amount of juice consumed. We can simply subtract the amount of juice remaining at inﬁnity from the initial amount of juice in the cup, which of course is simply the volume of the cup; we’ll denote this value by $V$. Since volume in the cup varies as the cube of height, the amount of juice remaining in the cup after $m$ minutes is $V \cdot \prod_{n=1}^m \left( 1 - \frac{1}{9n^2} \right) = V \prod_{n=1}^m \left( \frac{3n - 1}{3n + 1} \right)$. We can now factor the term inside the product to find $V \prod_{n=1}^m \frac{(3n - 1)(3n + 1)}{9n^2 - 1} = V \frac{(3m + 1)!}{3^{3m}(m!)^3}$. If remains to evaluate the limit of this expression as $m$ goes to inﬁnity. However, by Stirling’s approximation, we have $\lim_{m \to \infty} \frac{(3m + 1)!}{3^{3m}(m!)^3} = \lim_{m \to \infty} \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2\pi} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2\pi}$. Therefore the total amount of juice the king consumes is $V - V \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2\pi} = V (1 - \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2\pi})$. The volume of the cone is $V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h = \frac{1}{3} \pi (3)^2 (9) = 27\pi$. Then $r = 27\pi (1 - \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2\pi}) = 27\pi - \frac{81\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 84.823 - 70.148 \approx 14.675$. Then $r = 27\pi - \frac{81\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{54\pi - 81\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 14.675$. The answer is $\boxed{\frac{216\pi^3}{2187\sqrt{3}}}$."

After the second addition, the second bit of $M$ is toggled with probability $\frac{1}{2}$. After the third addition, the third bit is toggled with probability $\frac{1}{2}$, and so on for the remaining three additions. As such, the six bits of $M$ are each toggled with probability $\frac{1}{2}$ - specifically, the $k$th bit is toggled with probability $\frac{1}{2}$ at the $k$th addition, and is never toggled afterwards.

For $k \ge 2$, if $a \uparrow\uparrow k$ and $a \uparrow\uparrow (k+1)$ are distinct mod $p^r$, then $a \uparrow\uparrow (k-1)$ and $a \uparrow\uparrow k$ must be distinct mod $\phi(p^r)$.

If $n$ is a prime power less than 283 such that $a \uparrow\uparrow 6$ and $a \uparrow\uparrow 7$ are distinct mod $n$, then the prime can be at most 13 and clearly this doesn’t work because $\phi(p^r) = p^{r-1}(p-1)$.

What is the expected total suffering of all 256 students, in hours?","Let $n = 8$. $\frac{2^{135} - 2^{128} + 1}{2^{119} \cdot 129}$ First, consider any given student S and an antigen $a$ foreign to him/her. Assuming S has been bitten, we claim the probability S will suffer due to $a$ is $1 - \frac{2^{2n-1} + 1 - 1}{2^{2n-1}} (2^{n-1} + 1)$. Indeed, let $N = 2^{n-1}$ denote the number of students with $a$. So considering just these students and summing over the number bitten, we obtain a probability $\frac{1}{2^N} \sum_{t=0}^N \binom{N}{t} \binom{N}{t} \frac{t}{t+1} = \frac{1}{2^N} \frac{2^N (N - 2^N + 1)}{N+1}$. We now use linearity over all pairs (S, a) of students S and antigens a foreign to them. Noting that each student is bitten with probability $\frac{1}{2}$, and retaining the notation $N = 2^{n-1}$, we get $\frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \cdot k \binom{2^N}{N - 2^N + 1} \frac{2^N}{N+1} = nN \frac{2^N (N - 2^N + 1)}{2^{2N} (N+1)}$.

"Determine the number of triples $0 \le k, m, n \le 100$ of integers such that $2^m n - 2^n m = 2^k$.","First consider when $n \ge m$, so let $n = m + d$ where $d \ge 0$. Then we have $2^m(m + d - 2^d m) = 2^m(m(1 - 2^d) + d)$, which is non-positive unless $m = 0$. So our first set of solutions is $m = 0, n = 2^j$. Now, we can assume that $m > n$, so let $m = n + d$ where $d > 0$. Rewrite $2^m n - 2^n m = 2^{n+d} n - 2^n (n + d) = 2^n ((2^d - 1)n - d)$. In order for this to be a power of 2, $(2^d - 1)n - d$ must be a power of 2. This implies that for some $j$, $2^j \equiv -d \pmod{2^d - 1}$. But notice that the powers of 2 (mod $2^d - 1$) are 1, 2, 4, ..., $2^{d-1}$ ($2^d \equiv 1$ so the cycle repeats). In order for the residues to match, we need $2^j + d = c(2^d - 1)$, where $0 \le j \le d - 1$ and $c \ge 1$. In order for this to be true, we must have $2^{d-1} + d \ge 2^d - 1 \iff d + 1 \ge 2^{d-1}$. This inequality is only true for $d = 1, 2, 3$. We plug each of these into the original expression $(2^d - 1)n - d$. For $d = 1$: $n - 1$ is a power of 2. This yields the set of solutions $(2^j + 2, 2^j + 1)$ for $j \ge 0$. This yields the solution set ($2^{2j} + 8/3$, $2^{2j} + 2/3$) For $d = 2$: $3n - 2$ is a power of 2. Note that powers of 2 are $-2 \pmod 3$ if and only if it is an even power, so $n = 2^{2j} + 2$ For $d = 3$: $7n - 3$ is a power of 2. Powers of 2 have a period of 3 when taken (mod 7), so inspection tells us $7n - 3 = 2^{3j+2}$, yielding the solution set ($2^{3j+2} + 24/7$, $2^{3j+2} + 3/7$) Therefore, all the solutions are of the form (m, n) = (0, 2j), ($2^j + 2, 2^j + 1$) ($2^{2j} + 8/3$, $2^{2j} + 2/3$), ($2^{3j+2} + 24/7$, $2^{3j+2} + 3/7$) for $j \ge 0$. Restricting this family to $m, n \le 100$ gives $7 + 7 + 5 + 3 = 22$. There are $\boxed{22}$ such triples."
"For a positive integer $n$, denote by $\tau(n)$ the number of positive integer divisors of $n$, and denote by $\phi(n)$ the number of positive integers that are less than or equal to $n$ and relatively prime to $n$. Call a positive integer $n$ good if $\phi(n) + 4\tau(n) = n$. For example, the number 44 is good because $\phi(44) + 4\tau(44) = 44$. Find the sum of all good positive integers $n$.","We claim that 44, 56, 72 are the only good numbers. It is easy to check that these numbers work. Now we prove none others work. First, remark that as $n = 1, 2$ fail so we have $\phi(n)$ is even, thus $n$ is even. This gives us $\phi(n) \le n/2$. Now remark that $\tau(n) < 2\sqrt{n} \implies n \le 256$. This gives us a preliminary bound. Note that in addition we have $8\tau(n) > n$. Now, it is easy to see that powers of 2 fail. Thus let $n = 2^a p_1^b$ where $p_1$ is an odd prime. From $8\tau(n) > n$ we get $8(a+1)(b+1) > 2^a p_1^b$ from which we get that $(a, b)$ is one of $(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1)$. Remark that $p_1 \le b \sqrt{\frac{8(a+1)(b+1)}{2^a}}$. From this we can perform some casework: $\bullet$ If $a = 1, b = 1$ then $p_1 - 1 + 16 = 2p_1$ but then $p = 15$, absurd. $\bullet$ If $a = 1, b = 2$ then we have $p_1 \le 5$ which is obviously impossible. $\bullet$ If $a = 1, b = 3$ then $p_1 \le 4$ which is impossible. $\bullet$ If $a = 2, b = 1$ then $p_1 \le 12$ and it is easy to check that $p_1 = 11$ and thus $n = 44$ is the only solution. $\bullet$ If $a = 2, b = 2$ then $p_1 \le 4$ which is impossible. $\bullet$ If $a = 3, b = 1$ then $p_1 \le 8$ and only $p_1 = 7$ or $n = 56$ works. $\bullet$ If $a = 3, b = 2$ then $p_1 \le 3$ and $p_1 = 3$, $n = 72$ works. $\bullet$ If $a = 4, b = 1$ then $p_1 \le 1$ which is absurd. Now suppose $n$ is the product of 3 distinct primes, so $n = 2^a p_1^b p_2^c$ then we must have $8(a+1)(b+1)(c+1) > n$, so we have $8(a+1)(b+1)(c+1) > 2^a p_1^b p_2^c$. Again, we can do some casework: (1, 1, 1), (1, 2, 1), (2, 1, 1), (3, 1, 1). $\bullet$ If $a = b = c = 1$ then $8\tau(n) = 64 > 2p_1 p_2$ but then $p_1 = 3, p_2 = 5$ or $p_1 = 3, p_2 = 7$ is forced neither of which work. $\bullet$ If $a = 1, b = 2, c = 1$ then $8\tau(n) = 96 > 2p_1^2 p_2$ but then $p_1 = 3, p_2 = 5$ is forced which does not work. $\bullet$ If $a = 2, b = 1, c = 1$ then $8\tau(n) = 96 > 4p_1 p_2$ forces $p_1 = 3, p_2 = 5$ or $p_1 = 3, p_2 = 7$ neither of which work. $\bullet$ If $a = 3, b = 1, c = 1$ then $8\tau(n) = 108 > 8p_1 p_2$ which has no solutions for $p_1, p_2$. Finally, take the case where $n$ is the product of at least 4 distinct primes. But then $n \ge 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 = 210$ and as $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 11 > 256$, it suffices to check only the case of 210. But 210 clearly fails, so it follows that 44, 56, 72 are the only good numbers so we are done. The sum of all good integers is $44 + 56 + 72 = \boxed{172}$."
"How many equilateral hexagons of side length $\sqrt{13}$ have one vertex at (0, 0) and the other five vertices at lattice points?","We perform casework on the point three vertices away from (0, 0). By inspection, that point can be ($\pm 8, \pm 3$), ($\pm 7, \pm 2$), ($\pm 4, \pm 3$), ($\pm 3, \pm 2$), ($\pm 2, \pm 1$) or their reflections across the line $y = x$. The cases are as follows: If the third vertex is at any of ($\pm 8, \pm 3$) or ($\pm 3, \pm 8$), then there are 7 possible hexagons. There are 8 points of this form, contributing 56 hexagons. If the third vertex is at any of ($\pm 7, \pm 2$) or ($\pm 2, \pm 7$), there are 6 possible hexagons, contributing 48 hexagons. If the third vertex is at any of ($\pm 4, \pm 3$) or ($\pm 3, \pm 4$), there are again 6 possible hexagons, contributing 48 more hexagons. If the third vertex is at any of ($\pm 3, \pm 2$) or ($\pm 2, \pm 3$), then there are again 6 possible hexagons, contributing 48 more hexagons. Finally, if the third vertex is at any of ($\pm 2, \pm 1$), then there are 2 possible hexagons only, contributing 16 hexagons. Adding up, we get our answer of 216. There are $\boxed{216}$ such hexagons."
"Let $P(x)$, $Q(x)$ be nonconstant polynomials with real number coefficients. Prove that if for all real numbers $y$, $|P(y)| = |Q(y)|$, then $P(x) = Q(x)$ for all real numbers $x$.","By the condition, we know that $|P(x) - Q(x)| \le 1$ for all $x$. This can only hold if $P(x) - Q(x)$ is a constant polynomial. Now take a constant $c$ such that $P(x) = Q(x) + c$. Without loss of generality, we can assume that $c \ge 0$. Assume that $c > 0$. By continuity, if $\deg P = \deg Q > 0$, we can select an integer $r$ and a real number $x_0$ such that $Q(x_0) + c = r$. Then $\lfloor P(x_0) \rfloor = \lfloor Q(x_0) + c \rfloor = r$. On the other hand, $\lfloor Q(x_0) \rfloor = \lfloor r - c \rfloor < r$ as $r$ was an integer. This is a contradiction. Therefore, $c = 0$ as desired."
"Does there exist a two-variable polynomial $P(x, y)$ with real number coefficients such that $P(x, y)$ is positive exactly when $x$ and $y$ are both positive?","No. For any $\epsilon$ and positive $x$, $P(x, \epsilon) > 0$ and $P(x, -\epsilon) \le 0$. Thus by continuity/IVT, $P(x, 0) = 0$ for all positive $x$. Similarly $P(0, y) = 0$ for all positive $y$. This implies $xy | P(x, y)$, and so we can write $P(x, y) = xyQ(x, y)$. But then this same logic holds for $Q$, and this cannot continue infinitely unless $P$ is identically 0 – in which case the conditions do not hold. So no such polynomial exists."
A polyhedron has $7n$ faces. Show that there exist $n+1$ of the polyhedron’s faces that all have the same number of edges.,"Let $V$, $E$, and $F$ denote the number of vertices, edges, and faces respectively. Let $a_k$ denote the number of faces with $k$ sides, and let $M$ be the maximum number of sides any face has. Suppose that $a_k \le n$ for all $k$ and that $M > 8$. Note that each edge is part of exactly two faces, and each vertex is part of at least three faces. It follows that $\sum_{k=3}^M ka_k = 2E \ge 3V$ and in particular $\sum_{k=3}^M (\frac{a_k}{2} - \frac{k}{6} + \frac{1}{3}) \ge F - E + V = 2$ by Euler’s formula. But on the other hand, $a_k \le n$ by assumption, so $\sum_{k=3}^M (\frac{a_k}{2} - \frac{k}{6}) \le \sum_{k=3}^M (\frac{n}{2} - \frac{k}{6}) = \frac{n(M-2)}{2} - \frac{M(M+1)}{12} + \frac{1}{2} \le \frac{n(M-8)}{2}$. Thus $2 \le \frac{7n}{2} - \frac{7n(M-8)}{2}$ implies $M \le 9$. Thus $M \le 8$, and as each face has at least 3 edges, the result follows directly from Pigeonhole."

Let $p$ be a prime. A complete residue class modulo $p$ is a set containing at least one element equivalent to $k \pmod{p}$ for all $k$. (a) Show that there exists an $n$ such that the $n$th row of Pascal’s triangle forms a complete residue class modulo $p$. (b) Show that there exists an $n \le p^2$ such that the $n$th row of Pascal’s triangle forms a complete residue class modulo $p$.,"We use the following theorem of Lucas: Theorem. Given a prime $p$ and nonnegative integers $a$, $b$ written in base $p$ as $a = a_n a_{n-1} \dots a_0p$ and $b = b_n b_{n-1} \dots b_0p$ respectively, where $0 \le a_i, b_i \le p - 1$ for $0 \le i \le n$, we have $\binom{a}{b} \equiv \prod_{i=0}^n \binom{a_i}{b_i} \pmod{p}$. Now, let $n = (p-1) \times p + (p-2) = p^2 - 2$. For $k = pq + r$ with $0 \le q, r \le p - 1$, applying Lucas’s theorem gives $\binom{n}{k} \equiv \binom{p-1}{q} \binom{p-2}{r} \pmod{p}$. Note that $\binom{p-1}{q} \equiv (-1)^q \pmod{p}$, and $\binom{p-2}{r} \equiv (-1)^r (r+1) \pmod{p}$. So for $2 \le i \le p$ we can take $k = (p+1)(i-1)$ and obtain $\binom{n}{k} \equiv i \pmod{p}$, while for $i = 1$ we can take $k = 0$. Thus this row satisfies the desired property."
Does there exist an irrational number $\alpha > 1$ such that $\lfloor \alpha^n \rfloor \equiv 0 \pmod{2017}$ for all integers $n \ge 1$?,Yes. Let $\alpha > 1$ and $0 < \beta < 1$ be the roots of $x^2 - 4035x + 2017$. Then note that $\lfloor \alpha^n \rfloor = \alpha^n + \beta^n - 1$. Let $x_n = \alpha^n + \beta^n$ for all nonnegative integers $n$. It’s easy to verify that $x_n = 4035x_{n-1} - 2017x_{n-2} \equiv x_{n-1} \pmod{2017}$ so since $x_1 = 4035 \equiv 1 \pmod{2017}$ we have that $x_n \equiv 1 \pmod{2017}$ for all $n$. Thus $\alpha$ satisfies the problem.

Continuing, this gives that the total number of triples is $1 + 2 + \cdots + 10 = 55$. Therefore, our final answer is $\frac{55}{1000} = \boxed{\frac{11}{200}}$."
How many ways are there to insert +’s between the digits of 111111111111111 (fifteen 1’s) so that the result will be a multiple of 30?,"Note that because there are 15 1’s, no matter how we insert +’s, the result will always be a multiple of 3. Therefore, it suffices to consider adding +’s to get a multiple of 10. By looking at the units digit, we need the number of summands to be a multiple of 10. Because there are only 15 digits in our number, we have to have exactly 10 summands. Therefore, we need to insert 9 +’s in 14 possible positions, giving an answer of $\binom{14}{9} = \boxed{2002}$."
"There are 2017 jars in a row on a table, initially empty. Each day, a nice man picks ten consecutive jars and deposits one coin in each of the ten jars. Later, Kelvin the Frog comes back to see that N of the jars all contain the same positive integer number of coins (i.e. there is an integer $d > 0$ such that N of the jars have exactly d coins). What is the maximum possible value of N?","Label the jars 1, 2, ..., 2017. I claim that the answer is 2014. To show this, we need both a construction and an upper bound. For the construction, for $1 \le i \le 201$, put a coin in the jars $10i + 1, 10i + 2, \dots, 10i + 10$. After this, each of the jars 1, 2, ..., 2010 has exactly one coin. Now, put a coin in each of the jars 2008, 2009, ..., 2017. Now, the jars 1, 2, ..., 2007, 2011, 2012, ..., 2017 all have exactly one coin. This gives a construction for $N = 2014$ (where $d = 1$). Now, we show that this is optimal. Let $c_1, c_2, \dots, c_{2017}$ denote the number of coins in each of the jars. For $1 \le j \le 10$, define $s_j = c_j + c_{j+10} + c_{j+20} + \dots$. Note that throughout the process, $s_1 = s_2 = \dots = s_j$. It is also easy to check that the sums $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_7$ each involve 202 jars, while the sums $s_8, s_9, s_{10}$ each involve 201 jars. Call a jar good if it has exactly d coins. If there are at least 2015 good jars, then one can check that it is forced that at least one of $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_7$ only involves good jars, and similarly, at least one of $s_8, s_9, s_{10}$ only involves good jars. But this would mean that $202d = 201d$ as all $s_i$ are equal, contradiction. Thus, the maximum possible value of N is $\boxed{2014}$."
Sam spends his days walking around the following $2 \times 2$ grid of squares. 1 4 2 3 Say that two squares are adjacent if they share a side. He starts at the square labeled 1 and every second walks to an adjacent square. How many paths can Sam take so that the sum of the numbers on every square he visits in his path is equal to 20 (not counting the square he started on)?,"We can follow a similar approach by doing casework on the number of steps he takes. I will simply list them out here for brevity. For 8 steps, we get $\binom{8}{4} = 70$. For 12 steps, we get a contribution of $\binom{12}{6} = 924$. For 13 steps, we get a contribution of $\binom{13}{6} = 1716$. For 9 steps, we get $\binom{9}{4} = 126$. For 10 steps, we get $\binom{10}{5} = 252$. For 11 steps, we get $\binom{11}{5} = 462$.  Therefore, the final answer is $70 + 924 + 1716 + 126 + 252 + 462 = \boxed{3550}$."
"Kelvin the Frog likes numbers whose digits strictly decrease, but numbers that violate this condition in at most one place are good enough. In other words, if $d_i$ denotes the $i$th digit, then $d_i \le d_{i+1}$ for at most one value of $i$. For example, Kelvin likes the numbers 43210, 132, and 3, but not the numbers 1337 and 123. How many 5-digit numbers does Kelvin like?","Suppose first that no digit violates the constraint; i.e. the digits are in strictly decreasing order. There are $\binom{10}{5}$ ways to choose the digits of the number, and each set of digits can be arranged in exactly one way, so there are $\binom{10}{5} = 252$ such numbers. We now perform casework on which digit violates the constraint. If it is the final digit, the first four digits must be arranged in decreasing order, which there are $\binom{10}{4}$ ways to do. The final digit can then be any digit, but we have overcounted the ones in which the number is in fully decreasing order.  The case where the third digit is the offender is identical to the previous case, so there are another $\binom{10}{4} - 252$ new numbers in this case. The final case is when the second digit is the offending digit, in which case there are $\binom{10}{4} \cdot 9 - 252$ new numbers in this case.  The final answer is $252 + 4(\binom{10}{4} - 252) + \binom{10}{4} \cdot 9 - 252 = \boxed{14034}$."
"Emily starts with an empty bucket. Every second, she either adds a stone to the bucket or removes a stone from the bucket, each with probability $\frac{1}{2}$. If she wants to remove a stone from the bucket and the bucket is currently empty, she merely does nothing for that second (still with probability $\frac{1}{2}$). What is the probability that after 2017 seconds her bucket contains exactly 1337 stones?","Replace 2017 with $n$ and 1337 with $k$ and denote the general answer by $f(n, k)$. I claim that $f(n, k) = \frac{1}{2^n} \binom{n}{\frac{n+k}{2}}$. We proceed by induction on $n$. The claim is obviously true for $n = 0$ since $f(0, 0) = 1$. Moreover, we have that $f(n, k) = \frac{1}{2} f(n - 1, k - 1) + \frac{1}{2} f(n - 1, k + 1)$ for $k > 0$ so the inductive step is immediate by Pascal’s identity. This concludes the proof.  For $n = 2017$ and $k = 1337$, the answer is $\frac{1}{2^{2017}} \binom{2017}{1677} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2^{2017}}\binom{2017}{340}}$."

Let D be the number of distinct possible values of N, and let S be the sum of all possible values of N. Find the ordered pair (D, S).","I claim that N can equal 0 or $2i$ for $1 \le i \le 1008$. We prove this now. Note that the average number of friends a toad has is also 2. If there is a toad with 0 friends, then clearly $N = 0$. If a toad has 1 friend, then it must be paired with its only friend, so we have reduced to a smaller case. Otherwise, all toads and frogs have exactly degree 2, so the graph is a union of cycles. Each cycle can be paired off in exactly two ways. The number of cycles can range anywhere from 1 to 1008, and this completes the proof. To construct all $N = 2^1, 2^2, \dots, 2^{1008}$, we can simply let our graph be a union of i cycles, which would have $2^i$ matchings. Clearly we can choose any $i = 1, 2, \dots, 1008$. Therefore, $D = 1009$ and $S = 2^1 + 2^2 + \dots + 2^{1008} = 2^{1009} - 2$. Thus, the ordered pair is $\boxed{(1009, 2^{1009} - 2)}$."

What is the maximum possible area of the triangle?","There are three cases: $\ell$ intersects AB, AC, $\ell$ intersects AB, BC, and $\ell$ intersects AC, BC. These cases are essentially identical, so let $\ell$ intersect segment AB at M and segment AC at N. Then the condition is equivalent to AM + MN + AN = MB + BC + CN + MN $\implies$ AM + AN = MB + CN + 15 but AN + CN = 14 and AM + BM = 13, so that BM + CN = 27 - AM - AN = AM - AN - 15 implying that AM + AN = 21. Now let $\angle BAC = \theta$ for convenience, so that $[AMN] = \frac{1}{2} AM \cdot AN \cdot \sin \theta$ which is maximized when AM = AN = $\frac{21}{2}$ (e.g. by LOC); note that this is why the area is maximized in this case (we want to maximize $\sin \theta$, which is equivalent to maximizing $\theta$, so $\theta$ should be opposite the largest side).

If the radius of $\Gamma$ is 17, the radius of $\omega$ is 7, and $\frac{AQ}{BQ} = 3$, find the circumradius of triangle AQR.","Let r denote the circumradius of triangle AQR. By Archimedes Lemma, R is the midpoint of arc AB of $\Gamma$. Therefore $\angle RAQ = \angle RPB = \angle RPA$ so $\triangle RAQ \sim \triangle RPA$. By looking at the similarity ratio between the two triangles we have $\frac{r}{17} = \frac{AQ}{AP}$. Now, let AP intersect $\omega$ again at X $\ne$ P. By homothety we have XQ $\perp$ AR so $\frac{AX}{AP} = 1 - \frac{PQ}{PR} = 1 - \frac{7}{17} = \frac{10}{17}$. But we also know $AX \cdot AP = AQ^2$ so $\frac{10}{17} AP^2 = AQ^2$. Thus $\frac{r}{17} = \frac{AQ}{AP} = \sqrt{\frac{10}{17}}$ so we compute $r = \sqrt{170}$ as desired."
Let ABC be a triangle with circumradius R = 17 and inradius r = 7. Find the maximum possible value of $\sin \frac{A}{2}$.,Letting I and O denote the incenter and circumcenter of triangle ABC we have by the triangle inequality that $AO \le AI + OI \implies R \le \frac{r}{\sin \frac{A}{2}} + \sqrt{R^2 - 2Rr}$ and by plugging in our values for r and R we get $\sin \frac{A}{2} \le \sqrt{\frac{17 + \sqrt{51}}{34}}$ as desired. Equality holds when ABC is isosceles and I lies between A and O.
"Let ABC be a triangle, and let BCDE, CAF G, ABHI be squares that do not overlap the triangle with centers X, Y, Z respectively. Given that AX = 6, BY = 7, and CZ = 8, find the area of triangle XYZ.",By the degenerate case of Von Aubel’s Theorem we have that YZ = AX = 6 and ZX = BY = 7 and XY = CZ = 8 so it suffices to find the area of a 6-7-8 triangle which is given by $\sqrt{21 \cdot 15} / 2 = \frac{\sqrt{315}}{2} = \frac{3 \sqrt{35}}{2} \approx 8.87.$

"Find the number of pairs of integers (x, y) such that $x^2 + 2y^2 < 25$.","We do casework on y. If y = 0, we have $x^2 < 25$, so we get 9 values of x. If y = $\pm 1$, then $x^2 < 23$, so we still have 9 values of x. If y = $\pm 2$, we have $x^2 < 17$, so we have 9 values of x. If y = $\pm 3$, we have $x^2 < 7$, we get 5 values of x.

"Find the number of ordered triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy $(ab + 1)(bc + 1)(ca + 1) = 84$.","The solutions are (0, 1, 83) and (1, 2, 3) up to permutation. First, we do the case where at least one of a, b, c is 0. WLOG, say a = 0. Then we have $1 + bc = 84 \implies bc = 83$. As 83 is prime, the only solution is (0, 1, 83) up to permutation. Otherwise, we claim that at least one of a, b, c is equal to 1. Otherwise, all are at least 2, so $(1 + ab)(1 + bc)(1 + ac) \ge 5^3 = 125 > 84$. So WLOG, set a = 1. We now need $(b + 1)(c + 1)(bc + 1) = 84$. Now, WLOG, say $b \le c$. If b = 1, then $(c + 1)^2(c+1) = 42$, which has no solution. If $b \ge 3$, then $(b + 1)(c + 1)(bc + 1) \ge 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 10 = 160 > 84$. So we need b = 2. Then we need $(c + 1)(2c + 1) = 21$. Solving this gives c = 3, for the solution (1, 2, 3). Therefore, the answer is $6 + 6 = 12$."
"Find the number of ordered triples of positive integers (a, b, c) such that $6a + 10b + 15c = 3000$.","Note that 6a must be a multiple of 5, so a must be a multiple of 5. Similarly, b must be a multiple of 3, and c must be a multiple of 2. Set a = 5A, b = 3B, c = 2C. Then the equation reduces to A + B + C = 100.

"An ordered pair of sets (A, B) is good if A is not a subset of B and B is not a subset of A. How many ordered pairs of subsets of {1, 2, . . . , 2017} are good?","Firstly, there are $4^{2017}$ possible pairs of subsets, as each of the 2017 elements can be in neither subset, in A only, in B only, or in both. Now let us count the number of pairs of subsets for which A is a subset of B. Under these conditions, each of the 2017 elements could be in neither subset, in B only, or in both A and B. So there are $3^{2017}$ such pairs. By symmetry, there are also $3^{2017}$ pairs of subsets where B is a subset of A. But this overcounts the pairs in which A is a subset of B and B is a subset of A, i.e. A = B. There are $2^{2017}$ such subsets. Thus, in total, there are $4^{2017} - 2 \cdot 3^{2017} + 2^{2017}$ good pairs of subsets."

Find $\lim_{n\to\infty} M_n$.","Let R denote the circumradius of triangle ABC. As ABC is an acute triangle, it isn’t hard to check that for any point P , we have either AP ≥ R, BP ≥ R, or CP ≥ R. Also, note that if we choose P = O (the circumcenter) then $(AP^n + BP^n + CP^n) = 3 \cdot R^n$. Therefore, we have the inequality $R \le \min_{P \in \mathbb{R}^2} (AP^n + BP^n + CP^n)^{\frac{1}{n}} \le (3R^n)^{\frac{1}{n}} = R \cdot 3^{\frac{1}{n}}$. Taking $n \to \infty$ yields $R \le \lim_{n\to\infty} M_n \le R$ (as $\lim_{n\to\infty} 3^{\frac{1}{n}} = 1$), so the answer is $R = \frac{65}{8}$."
Consider the graph in 3-space of $0 = xyz(x + y)(y + z)(z + x)(x - y)(y - z)(z - x)$. This graph divides 3-space into N connected regions. What is N ?,"Note that reﬂecting for each choice of sign for x, y, z, we get new regions. Therefore, we can restrict to the case where x, y, z > 0. In this case, the sign of the expression only depends on $(x - y)(y - z)(z - x)$. It is easy to see that for this expression, every one of the $3! = 6$ orderings for {x, y, z} contributes a region. Therefore, our answer is $2^3 \cdot 3! = 48$."

Therefore, the number of distinct substrings is at most $\sum_{l=1}^{66} \min(4^l, 67 - l) = 2178$. The problem asks for the maximum number of distinct substrings.

Then they can be written as $m^2 - n^2$, $2mn$, $m^2 + n^2$ for some coprime integers m and n where m > n and mn is even. Then we obtain $\frac{P^2}{A} = \frac{4m(m+n)}{n(m-n)}$. But n, m - n, m, m + n are all pairwise coprime so for this to be an integer we need $n(m - n)|4$ and by checking each case we find that (m, n) = (5, 4) yields the maximum ratio of 45."

What was the prime p?","Let $p = 2d + 1$, $50 < d < 250$. The information in the problem boils down to $2016 = d + 21 \pmod{2d}$. From this we can at least read off $d | 1995$. Now factor $1995 = 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 19$. The values of d in this interval are 105, 133. The prime values of $2d + 1$ are then 211. This is because $2^{2016} \equiv 2^{2016 \pmod{p-1}} \pmod p$, and we know that $2016 \equiv e \pmod{p-1}$ and $e = 21 + \frac{p-1}{2}$, so $2^{2016} \equiv 2^{21 + \frac{p-1}{2}} \equiv 2^{21} 2^{\frac{p-1}{2}} \equiv -2^{21} \pmod p$ when $(\frac{2}{p}) = -1$.

Now start with the empty set and add in the elements $s_i$ in order. During this process, we will keep track of all possible remainders of sums of any subset. If $T$ is the set of current remainders at any time, and we add an element $s_i$, the set of remainders will be $T \cup \{t + s_i|t \in T\}$. In particular, the set of remainders only depends on the previous set of remainders and the element we add in. At the beginning of our process, the set of possible remainders is $\{0\}$ for the empty set. Since we assumed that $S$ is comprehensive, the final set is $\{0, 1, \dots, n\}$. The number of elements changes from 1 to $n − 1$. However, since we added $k \ge n$ elements, at least one element did not change the size of our remainder set. This implies that adding this element did not contribute to making any new remainders and $S$ is still comprehensive without this element, proving our claim."
"For some real number $c$, the graphs of the equation $y = |x − 20| + |x + 18|$ and the line $y = x + c$ intersect at exactly one point. What is $c$?","We want to know the value of $c$ so that the graph $|x − 20| + |x + 18| − x = c$ has one solution. The graph of the function $|x − 20| + |x + 18| − x$ consists of an infinite section of slope $−3$ for $x ∈ (−∞, −18]$, then a finite section of slope $−1$ for $x ∈ [−18, 20]$, then an infinite section of slope $1$ for $x ∈ [20, ∞)$. Notice that this graph is strictly decreasing on $(−∞, 20]$ and strictly increasing on $[20, ∞)$. Therefore any horizontal line will intersect this graph $0$ or $2$ times, except the one that passes through the “vertex” $(20, |20 − 20| + |20 + 18| − 20) = (20, 18)$, giving a value of $c = 18$."
Compute the positive real number $x$ satisfying $x^{(2x^6)} = 3$.,"Let $t = x^6$, so $x^{2t} = 3$. Taking this to the third power gives $x^{6t} = 27$, or equivalently $t^t = 3^3$. We can see by inspection that $t = 3$, and this is the only solution as for $t > 1$, the function $t^t$ is monotonically increasing, and if $0 < t < 1$, $t^t < 1$. Solving for $x$ gives $x^6 = 3$, or $x = \sqrt[6]{3}$."
There are two prime numbers $p$ so that $5p$ can be expressed in the form $n^2$. What is the sum of these two prime numbers?,"Note that the remainder when $n^2$ is divided by 5 must be 0, 1, or 4. Then we have that $25p = n^2$ or $25p = n^2 − 1$ or $25p = n^2 − 4$. In the second case, if $25p = (n − 1)(n + 1)$, then we must have $n − 1 = 25$ or $n + 1 = 25$ as $n − 1$ and $n + 1$ cannot both be divisible by 5, and also cannot both have a factor besides 25. Similarly, in the third case, $25p = (n − 2)(n + 2)$, so we must have $n − 2 = 25$ or $n + 2 = 25$. In the first case there are no solutions. Therefore the $n$ we have to check are 23, 24, 26, 27. These give values of $p = 21, p = 23, p = 27$, and $p = 29$, of which only 23 and 29 are prime, so the answer is $23 + 29 = 52$."
"Distinct prime numbers $p, q, r$ satisfy the equation $2pqr + 50pq = 7pqr + 55pr = 8pqr + 12qr = A$ for some positive integer $A$. What is $A$?","Note that $A$ is a multiple of $p$, $q$, and $r$, so $K = \frac{A}{pqr}$ is an integer. Dividing through, we have that $K = 8 + \frac{12}{p} = 7 + \frac{55}{q} = 2 + \frac{50}{r}$. Then $p ∈ \{2, 3\}$, $q ∈ \{5, 11\}$, and $r ∈ \{2, 5\}$. These values give $K ∈ \{14, 12\}$, $K ∈ \{18, 12\}$, and $K ∈ \{27, 12\}$, giving $K = 12$ and $(p, q, r) = (3, 11, 5)$. We can then compute $A = pqr·K = 3·11·5·12 = 1980$."
"Let $\alpha, \beta$, and $\gamma$ be three real numbers. Suppose that $\cos \alpha + \cos \beta + \cos \gamma = 1$ and $\sin \alpha + \sin \beta + \sin \gamma = 1$. Find the smallest possible value of $\cos \alpha$.","Let $a = \cos \alpha + i \sin \alpha$, $b = \cos \beta + i \sin \beta$, and $c = \cos \gamma + i \sin \gamma$. We then have $a + b + c = 1 + i$ where $a, b, c$ are complex numbers on the unit circle. Now, to minimize $\cos \alpha = \text{Re}[a]$, consider a triangle with vertices $a, 1 + i$, and the origin. We want $a$ as far away from $1 + i$ as possible while maintaining a nonnegative imaginary part. This is achieved when $b$ and $c$ have the same argument, so $b + c$ is a complex number parallel to the real axis. The value of $\cos \alpha$ is now $|b + c| = |1 + i − a| = \sqrt{2}$. Now $a, 0$, and $1 + i$ form a triangle. The value of $\cos \alpha$ is now $|1+i-a| = \sqrt{2}$. Now $a, 0, $ and $1+i$ form a triangle.  The value of $\cos \alpha$ is $\frac{\sqrt{7}-1}{4}$."
"Consider a $2 \times 3$ grid where each entry is one of 0, 1, and 2. For how many such grids is the sum of the numbers in every row and in every column a multiple of 3?","Any two elements in the same row fix the rest of the grid, so $3^2 = 9$."
Let $a$ and $b$ be five-digit palindromes (without leading zeroes) such that $a < b$ and there are no other five-digit palindromes strictly between $a$ and $b$. What are all possible values of $b - a$?,"Let $xyzyx$ be the digits of the palindrome $a$. There are three cases. If $z < 9$, then the next palindrome greater than $xyzyx$ is $xy(z+1)yx$, which differs by 100. If $z = 9$ but $y < 9$, then the next palindrome up is $x(y+1)0(y+1)x$, which differs from $xy9yx$ by 110. Finally, if $y = z = 9$, then the next palindrome after $x999x$ is $(x+1)000(x+1)$, which gives a difference of 11. Thus, the possible differences are 11, 100, 110."
"How many ways are there for Nick to travel from $(0, 0)$ to $(16, 16)$ in the coordinate plane by moving one unit in the positive $x$ or $y$ direction at a time, such that Nick changes direction an odd number of times?","This condition is equivalent to the first and last step being in different directions. If the first step is in the $x$ direction and the last step is in the $y$ direction, it suffices to count the number of paths from $(1, 0)$ to $(16, 15)$, of which there are $\binom{30}{15}$. Similarly, in the other case, it suffices to count the number of paths from $(0, 1)$ to $(15, 16)$, of which there are also $\binom{30}{15}$. Therefore the total number of paths is $2 \cdot \binom{30}{15}$."
"A bag contains nine blue marbles, ten ugly marbles, and one special marble. Ryan picks marbles randomly from this bag with replacement until he draws the special marble. He notices that none of the marbles he drew were ugly. Given this information, what is the expected value of the number of total marbles he drew?","The probability of drawing $k$ marbles is the probability of drawing $k-1$ blue marbles and then the special marble, which is $p_k = \left(\frac{9}{20}\right)^{k-1} \times \frac{1}{20}$. The probability of drawing no ugly marbles is therefore $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} p_k = \frac{1}{11}$. Then given that no ugly marbles were drawn, the probability that $k$ marbles were drawn is $11p_k$. The expected number of marbles Ryan drew is $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} k(11p_k) = 11 \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} k \left(\frac{9}{20}\right)^{k-1} \frac{1}{20} = \frac{20}{11}$."
"Sarah stands at $(0, 0)$ and Rachel stands at $(6, 8)$ in the Euclidean plane. Sarah can only move 1 unit in the positive $x$ or $y$ direction, and Rachel can only move 1 unit in the negative $x$ or $y$ direction. Each second, Sarah and Rachel see each other, independently pick a direction to move at the same time, and move to their new position. Sarah catches Rachel if Sarah and Rachel are ever at the same point. Rachel wins if she is able to get to $(0, 0)$ without being caught; otherwise, Sarah wins. Given that both of them play optimally to maximize their probability of winning, what is the probability that Rachel wins?","In a game with an $n \times m$ grid where $n \le m$ and $n \equiv m \pmod{2}$, the probability that Sarah wins is $\frac{1}{2^n}$ under optimal play.  The game will be reduced to $6 \times 6$ with optimal play, and thus the probability that Rachel wins is $1 - \frac{1}{2^6} = \frac{63}{64}$."
"Triangle GRT has GR = 5, RT = 12, and GT = 13. The perpendicular bisector of GT intersects the extension of GR at O. Find TO.","First, note that TO = GO as O lies on the perpendicular bisector of GT.

What is the ordered pair (m, M)?","By the triangle inequality on triangle ACD, AC + CD ≥ AD, or AC ≥ 7. The minimum of 7 can be achieved when A, C, D lie on a line in that order. By the triangle inequality on triangle ABC, AB + BC ≥ AC, or AC ≤ 9. The maximum of 9 can be achieved when A, B, C lie on a line in that order. This gives the answer (7, 9)."
"A paper equilateral triangle of side length 2 on a table has vertices labeled A, B, C. Let M be the point on the sheet of paper halfway between A and C. Over time, point M is lifted upwards, folding the triangle along segment BM, while A, B, and C remain on the table. This continues until A and C touch. Find the maximum volume of tetrahedron ABCM at any time during this process.","View triangle ABM as a base of this tetrahedron. Then relative to triangle ABM, triangle CBM rotates around segment BM on a hinge. Therefore the volume is maximized when C is farthest from triangle ABM, which is when triangles ABM and CBM are perpendicular. The volume in this case can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron as $\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot \sqrt{3} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{6}$."

Let f(x) be the function representing the area of the (possibly degenerate) hexagon for x ∈ [0, 0.5]. Since f(x) is equal to the given expression over (0, 0.5), we can conclude that f(0) and f(0.5) will also be equal to the expression when x = 0 and x = 0.5 respectively. In each of the cases, we can compute easily that f(0) = 1 and f(0.5) = 0, so by plugging them in, we get b = 8 and c = 2."

"Kevin starts with the vectors $(1, 0)$ and $(0, 1)$ and at each time step, he replaces one of the vectors with their sum. Find the cotangent of the minimum possible angle between the vectors after 8 time steps.","Say that the vectors Kevin has at some step are $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$. Notice that regardless of which vector he replaces with $(a + c, b + d)$, the area of the triangle with vertices $(0, 0)$, $(a, b)$, and $(c, d)$ is preserved with the new coordinates. We can see this geometrically: the parallelogram with vertices $(0, 0)$, $(a, b)$, $(c, d)$, and $(a + c, b + d)$ can be cut in half by looking at the triangle formed by any 3 of the vertices, which include the original triangle, and both possible triangles that might arise in the next step. Because the area is preserved, the minimum possible angle then arises when the two vectors, our sides, are as long as possible. This occurs when we alternate which vector is getting replaced for the sum. Given two vectors $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$, with $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} > \sqrt{c^2 + d^2}$, we would rather replace $(c, d)$ than $(a, b)$, and $(a + c, b + d)$ has a larger norm than $(a, b)$. Then at the $n$th step, Kevin has the vectors $(F_n, F_{n-1})$ and $(F_{n+1}, F_n)$, where $F_0 = 0$ and $F_1 = 1$. The tangent of the angle between them is the tangent of the difference of the angles they make with the x-axis, which is just their slope. We can then compute the cotangent as $\frac{F_n(F_{n+1} + F_{n-1})}{F_n^2 - F_{n-1}F_{n+1}}$. We can show (by induction) that $F_n(F_{n+1} + F_{n-1}) = F_{2n}$ and $F_n^2 - F_{n-1}F_{n+1} = (-1)^{n+1}$. Thus at the 8th step, the cotangent of the angle is $F_{16} = 987$."
"Find the largest positive integer $n$ for which there exist $n$ finite sets $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ with the property that for every $1 \le a < b < c \le n$, the equation $|X_a \cup X_b \cup X_c| = \sqrt[3]{abc}$ holds.","First, we construct an example for $N = 4$. Let $X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4$ be pairwise disjoint sets such that $X_1 = \emptyset$, $|X_2| = 1$, $|X_3| = 2$, and $|X_4| = 2$. It is straightforward to verify the condition. We claim that there are no five sets $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_5$ for which $\#(X_a \cup X_b \cup X_c) = \sqrt[3]{abc}$, for $1 \le a < b < c \le 5$. Note that showing the non-existence of five such sets implies that there are no $n$ sets with the desired property for $n \ge 5$ as well. Suppose, for sake of contradiction, that there are such $X_1, \dots, X_5$. Then, note that $|X_1 \cup X_2 \cup X_4| = 3$, $|X_1 \cup X_2 \cup X_5| = 4$, and $|X_2 \cup X_4 \cup X_5| = 7$. Note that $|X_1 \cup X_2 \cup X_4| + |X_1 \cup X_2 \cup X_5| = |X_2 \cup X_4 \cup X_5|$. For any sets $A, B, C, D$, we have the following two inequalities: $|A \cup B \cup C| + |A \cup B \cup D| \ge |A \cup B \cup C \cup D| \ge |B \cup C \cup D|$. For $A = X_1, B = X_2, C = X_4$, and $D = X_5$ in the situation above, we conclude that the equalities must both hold in both inequalities. The first equality shows that $X_1 \cup X_2 = \emptyset$, and therefore both $X_1$ and $X_2$ are empty. Now observe that $|X_1 \cup X_4 \cup X_5| = 5 \ne 7 = |X_2 \cup X_4 \cup X_5|$. This gives a contradiction."
"Let ABCD be a parallelogram. Points X and Y lie on segments AB and AD respectively, and AC intersects XY at point Z.

A coordinate bash can also be used by setting A to be the origin and letting the length of the square be 1.  Then, X and Y can be set as $(a, 0)$ and $(0, b)$ respectively, so the line XY has equation $bx + ay = ab$.  Z is then the point $(\frac{ab}{a+b}, \frac{ab}{a+b})$, so $\frac{AB}{AX} + \frac{AD}{AY} = \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{a+b}{ab} = \frac{AC}{AZ}$."

Let Z be a point on the unit circle.  Let X1, Y1 be the projections of Z onto the x- and y-axis respectively, and let X2, Y2 lie on the x- and y-axis respectively such that X2Y2 is tangent to the unit circle at Z. Then we have $OZ = X1Y1 = 1$, $X1Z = \sin \theta$, $Y1Z = \cos \theta$, $X2Z = \tan \theta$, $Y2Z = \cot \theta$, $OX2 = \sec \theta$, $OY2 = \csc \theta$. It then suffices to show that $0 < X2Y2 - X1X2 - Y1Y2 < 1 = X1Y1$. The left inequality is true because X1X2 and Y1Y2 are the projections of ZX2 and ZY2 onto x- and y-axis respectively. The right inequality is true because $X1X2 + X1Y1 + Y1Y2 > X2Y2$ by triangle inequality."
Find all positive integers n for which there do not exist n consecutive composite positive integers less than n!.,"The answer is 1, 2, 3, 4.

Find all positive integers n such that the unit segments of an n × n grid of unit squares can be partitioned into groups of three such that the segments of each group share a common vertex.,"The answer is $n \equiv 0, 2 \pmod{6}$.  This is necessary because the segments must come in pairs, making n even, and the total number of segments, $2n(n+1)$, must be a multiple of 3. This condition is also sufficient, as shown by constructions for n=2 and n=6, and an inductive argument to show that if it works for n=k, then it works for n=k+6."

X is diametrically opposite O on (BOC) and is the intersection of the tangents to (ABC) from B and C.  Since (T, D; B, C) = -1, T is on the polar of D with respect to (ABC). BC is the polar of X, and D lies on BC, so X lies on the polar of D. Therefore, TX is the polar of D with respect to (ABC), and $OD \perp TX$."
A convex polygon on the plane is called wide if the projection of the polygon onto any line in the same plane is a segment with length at least 1. Prove that a circle of radius 1 can be placed inside any wide polygon.,"This can be proven by considering the largest circle contained inside the polygon.  If this circle has radius less than 1/3, then it must be tangent to three sides of the polygon, forming a triangle. The inradius of this triangle can be shown to be at least 1/3, leading to a contradiction.  Alternatively, one can use the center of mass and support lines to derive a contradiction if a circle of radius 1/3 cannot be placed inside the polygon."

Then assign to $(a, b)$ an element of S that is in the subset associated to a but not in that associated to b. The color assigned to $(a, b)$ is not in b, while the color assigned to $(b, c)$ is in b, so they must be distinct."
"Let $p > 2$ be a prime number.  Let $f, g \in \mathbb{F}_p[x]$. The pair $(f, g)$ is called compositional if $f(g(x)) \equiv x^{p^2} - x$ in $\mathbb{F}_p[x]$. Find the number of compositional pairs.","The answer is $4p(p-1)$.  This can be shown by considering the degrees of $f$ and $g$.  There are three cases: $(\text{deg } f, \text{deg } g) = (1, p^2)$, $(p^2, 1)$, and $(p, p)$.  In the first two cases, there are $p(p-1)$ compositional pairs each. In the third case, $f(x) = ax^p + bx + c$ and $g(x) = dx^p + ex + f$, leading to $2p(p-1)$ compositional pairs.  Therefore, the total number of compositional pairs is $4p(p-1)$."
What is the value of $Q(1)$?,"At $x=1$, the expression is undefined due to division by zero. However, we are given that $Q(1) > 0$"
What is the smallest positive integer that cannot be written as the sum of two nonnegative palindromic integers?,"Every positive integer $N$ less than 21 can be written as the sum of two nonnegative palindromic integers. If $N$ is in the interval $[1, 9]$, then it can be written as $0 + N$. If $N$ is in the interval $[10, 18]$, it can be written as $9 + (N - 9)$. In addition, 19 and 20 can be written as $11 + 8$ and $11 + 9$, respectively.  21 cannot be expressed as the sum of two palindromes. Suppose $21 = a + b$ with $a \le b$. Then $b \ge 11$, and the only palindromic possibility for $b$ is $11$.  However, this gives $a = 10$, which is not a palindrome. Therefore, 21 is the smallest such integer."
Let $N = 2^{2^2}$ and $x$ be a real number such that $N^{N^N} = 2^{2^x}$. Find $x$.,"We have $N = 2^{2^2} = 16$. Then $N^{N^N} = 16^{16^{16}} = (2^4)^{(2^4)^{2^4}} = 2^{4 \cdot 2^{4 \cdot 2^4}} = 2^{4 \cdot 2^{64}} = 2^{2^2 \cdot 2^{64}} = 2^{2^{66}}$.  Therefore, $2^{2^x} = 2^{2^{66}}$, which implies $x = 66$."
"Let $x$ and $y$ be positive real numbers. Define $a = 1 + \frac{x}{y}$ and $b = 1 + \frac{y}{x}$. If $a^2 + b^2 = 15$, compute $a^3 + b^3$.","Note that $a - 1 = \frac{x}{y}$ and $b - 1 = \frac{y}{x}$ are reciprocals. Thus $(a - 1)(b - 1) = 1$, which simplifies to $ab = a + b$. Let $t = ab = a + b$. Then $a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab = t^2 - 2t = 15$, so $(t - 5)(t + 3) = 0$. Since $a, b > 0$, we must have $t = 5$. Then $a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3 - 3ab(a + b) = 5^3 - 3(5)(5) = 125 - 75 = 50$."
How many distinct permutations of the letters of the word REDDER are there that do not contain a palindromic substring of length at least two?,"If two identical letters are adjacent or have a single letter in between, there is clearly a palindromic substring of length (respectively) two or three. So there cannot be any such substrings. Say we have a permutation of the word REDDER without any palindromic substrings. Let us call the ﬁrst letter X. The second letter has to be diﬀerent, let us call it Y. The third letter cannot be X or Y, let it be Z. Again, the fourth letter cannot be Y or Z, and we only have 3 letters to choose from, so it has to be X. Continuing analogously, the ﬁfth letter has to be Y, and the sixth letter has to be Z. So any word satisfying the problem statement has to be of the form XYZXYZ. It is easy to check that such a word indeed does not have any palindromic substrings. X, Y, Z can be any permutation of R, E, D, giving a total of 6 possibilities."
"Your math friend Steven rolls ﬁve fair icosahedral dice (each of which is labelled 1, 2, ..., 20 on its sides). He conceals the results but tells you that at least half of the rolls are 20. Suspicious, you examine the ﬁrst two dice and ﬁnd that they show 20 and 19 in that order. Assuming that Steven is truthful, what is the probability that all three remaining concealed dice show 20?","The given information is equivalent to the ﬁrst two dice being 20 and 19 and there being at least two 20’s among the last three dice. Thus, we need to ﬁnd the probability that given at least two of the last three dice are 20’s, all three are. Since there is only one way to get all three 20’s and 3 \\cdot 19 = 57 ways to get exactly two 20’s, the probability is $\frac{1}{1+57} = \frac{1}{58}$."
"Reimu and Sanae play a game using 4 fair coins. Initially both sides of each coin are white. Starting with Reimu, they take turns to color one of the white sides either red or green. After all sides are colored, the 4 coins are tossed. If there are more red sides showing up, then Reimu wins, and if there are more green sides showing up, then Sanae wins. However, if there is an equal number of red sides and green sides, then neither of them wins. Given that both of them play optimally to maximize the probability of winning, what is the probability that Reimu wins?","Clearly Reimu will always color a side red and Sanae will always color a side green, because their situation is never worse oﬀ when a side of a coin changes to their own color. Since the number of red-only coins is always equal to the number of green-only coins, no matter how Reimu and Sanae color the coins, they will have an equal probability of winning by symmetry, so instead they will cooperate to make sure that the probability of a tie is minimized, which is when all 4 coins have diﬀerent colors on both sides (which can easily be achieved by Reimu coloring one side of a new coin red and Sanae immediately coloring the opposite side green). Therefore, the probability of Reimu winning is $\frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{7}{8}$. This is incorrect. The correct probability is $\frac{5}{16}$."
"Yannick is playing a game with 100 rounds, starting with 1 coin. During each round, there is a $n\%$ chance that he gains an extra coin, where $n$ is the number of coins he has at the beginning of the round. What is the expected number of coins he will have at the end of the game?","Let $X_i$ be the random variable which is the number of coins at the end of round $i$. Say that $X_0 = 1$ for convenience. Fix $i > 0$ and some positive integer $x$. Conditioning on the event $X_{i-1} = x$, there are only two cases with positive probability. In particular, and Therefore $\text{Pr}[X_i = x + 1 | X_{i-1} = x] = \frac{x}{100}$ and $\text{Pr}[X_i = x | X_{i-1} = x] = 1 - \frac{x}{100}$. A different way to understand this is that no matter how many coins Yannick has currently (as long as he does not have more than 100 coins, which is guaranteed in this problem), the expected number of coins after one round is always 1.01 times the current number of coins, so the expected value is multiplied by 1.01 each round. Therefore $E[X_{100}] = \left(\frac{101}{100}\right)^{100} E[X_0] = 1.01^{100}$. "
"Contessa is taking a random lattice walk in the plane, starting at (1, 1). (In a random lattice walk, one moves up, down, left, or right 1 unit with equal probability at each step.) If she lands on a point of the form (6m, 6n) for $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$, she ascends to heaven, but if she lands on a point of the form (6m + 3, 6n + 3) for $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$, she descends to hell. What is the probability that she ascends to heaven?","Let $P(m, n)$ be the probability that she ascends to heaven from point $(m, n)$. Then $P(6m, 6n) = 1$ and $P(6m + 3, 6n + 3) = 0$ for all integers $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$. At all other points, $4P(m, n) = P(m - 1, n) + P(m + 1, n) + P(m, n - 1) + P(m, n + 1)$ (1) This gives an inﬁnite system of equations. However, we can apply symmetry arguments to cut down the number of variables to something more manageable. We have $P(m, n) = P(m + 6a, n + 6b)$ for $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$, and $P(m, n) = P(n, m)$, and $P(m, n) = P(-m, n)$, and $P(m, n) = 1 - P(m + 3, n + 3)$ (since any path from the latter point to heaven corresponds with a path from the former point to hell, and vice versa). Applying Equation (1) to points (1, 1), (0, 1), and (0, 2), and using the above symmetries, we get the equations $4P(1, 1) = 2P(0, 1) + 1$, $4P(0, 1) = P(0, 2) + 2P(1, 1) + 1$, $4P(0, 2) = P(0, 1) + \frac{3}{2}$. Solving yields $P(1, 1) = \frac{13}{22}$. "
"A point P lies at the center of square ABCD. A sequence of points $\{P_n\}$ is determined by $P_0 = P$, and given point $P_i$, point $P_{i+1}$ is obtained by reflecting $P_i$ over one of the four lines AB, BC, CD, DA, chosen uniformly at random and independently for each $i$. What is the probability that $P_8 = P$?","WLOG, AB and CD are horizontal line segments and BC and DA are vertical. Then observe that we can consider the reﬂections over vertical lines separately from those over horizontal lines, as each reﬂection over a vertical line moves $P_i$ horizontally to point $P_{i+1}$, and vice versa. Now consider only the reﬂections over horizontal segments AB and CD. Note that it is impossible for $P_8$ to be in the same location vertical location as P if there are an odd number of these reﬂections. Then we consider the reﬂections in pairs: let w denote reﬂecting twice over AB, let x denote reﬂecting over AB and then CD, let y denote reﬂecting over CD and then AB, and let z denote reﬂecting twice over CD. Note that both w and z preserve the position of our point. Also note that in order to end at the same vertical location as P, we must have an equal number of x’s and y’s. Now we count the number of sequences of length at most 4 with this property. Now let the number of such sequences of length k be $a_k$.  The number of ways to combine 2 valid sequences of total length 4 is $\sum_{i=0}^4 a_i a_{4-i} \binom{8}{2i}$. We compute that this sum is 4900 total sequences of reﬂections that place $P_8$ at $P$. There are of course $4^8 = 65536$ total sequences of 8 reﬂections, each chosen uniformly at random, so our answer is $\frac{4900}{65536} = \frac{1225}{16384}$."
"In an election for the Peer Pressure High School student council president, there are 2019 voters and two candidates Alice and Celia (who are voters themselves). At the beginning, Alice and Celia both vote for themselves, and Alice’s boyfriend Bob votes for Alice as well. Then one by one, each of the remaining 2016 voters votes for a candidate randomly, with probabilities proportional to the current number of the respective candidate’s votes. For example, the ﬁrst undecided voter David has a $\frac{2}{3}$ probability of voting for Alice and a $\frac{1}{3}$ probability of voting for Celia. What is the probability that Alice wins the election (by having more votes than Celia)?","Let $P_n(m)$ be the probability that after $n$ voters have voted, Alice gets $m$ votes. We show by induction that for $n \ge 3$, the ratio $P_n(2) : P_n(3) : \dots : P_n(n - 1)$ is equal to $1 : 2 : \dots : (n - 2)$. We take a base case of $n = 3$, for which the claim is obvious. Then suppose the claim holds for $n = k$. Then $P_k(m) = \frac{2^{m-2}}{\binom{k-1}{2}}$. Then $P_{k+1}(i) = \frac{k-i}{k} P_k(i) + \frac{i-1}{k} P_k(i - 1) = \frac{2^{i-2}}{k\binom{k-1}{2}}$. Also, we can check $P_{k+1}(2) = \frac{2}{k}$, so indeed the claim holds for $n = k + 1$, and $P_{k+1}(k) = \frac{2^{k-2}}{k\binom{k-1}{2}}$. The probability that Ceila wins the election is then $\frac{2}{k}$. The probability that Alice wins is $\frac{1513}{2017}$. "
"For a positive integer $N$, we color the positive divisors of $N$ (including 1 and $N$) with four colors. A coloring is called multichromatic if whenever $a, b$ and $\gcd(a, b)$ are pairwise distinct divisors of $N$, then they have pairwise distinct colors. What is the maximum possible number of multichromatic colorings a positive integer can have if it is not the power of any prime?","First, we show that $N$ cannot have three distinct prime divisors. For the sake of contradiction, suppose $pqr|N$ for three distinct primes $p, q, r$. Then by the problem statement, $(p, q, 1)$, $(p, r, 1)$, and $(q, r, 1)$ have three distinct colors, so $(p, q, r, 1)$ has four distinct colors. In addition, $(pq, r, 1)$, $(pq, pr, p)$, and $(pq, qr, q)$ have three distinct colors, so $(pq, p, q, r, 1)$ has ﬁve distinct colors, contradicting the fact that there are only four possible colors. Similarly, if $p^3q|N$ for some distinct primes $p$ and $q$, then $(p, q, 1)$, $(p^2, q, 1)$, $(p^3, q, 1)$, $(p^2, pq, p)$, $(p^3, pq, p)$, and $(p^3, p^2q, p^2)$ are all triples with distinct colors, so $(1, q, p, p^2, p^3)$ must have ﬁve distinct colors, which is again a contradiction. We are therefore left with two possibilities: Case 1: $N = pq$. In this case, the only triple of factors that must have pairwise distinct colors is $(p, q, 1)$. We have $4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 24$ choices for these three, and 4 choices for $pq$ itself, giving $4 \cdot 24 = 96$ multichromatic colorings. Case 2: $N = p^2q$. In this case, the triples of pairwise distinctly colored factors are $(p, q, 1)$, $(p^2, q, 1)$, and $(p^2, pq, p)$. From this, we see that $(1, p, q, p^2)$ must have four distinct colors, and the color of $pq$ must be distinct from $p$ and $p^2$. There are $4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 24$ ways to assign the four distinct colors, 2 ways to assign the color of $pq$ after that, and 4 ways to color $p^2q$ after that, giving a total of $24 \cdot 2 \cdot 4 = 192$ monochromatic colorings. Therefore, there can be at most 192 multichromatic colorings."
How many ways can one ﬁll a 3 × 3 square grid with nonnegative integers such that no nonzero integer appears more than once in the same row or column and the sum of the numbers in every row and column equals 7?,"In what ways could we potentially ﬁll a single row? The only possibilities are if it contains the numbers (0, 0, 7) or (0, 1, 6) or (0, 2, 5) or (0, 3, 4) or (1, 2, 4). Notice that if we write these numbers in binary, in any choices for how to ﬁll the row, there will be exactly one number with a 1 in its rightmost digit, exactly one number with a 1 in the second digit from the right, and exactly exactly one number with a 1 in the third digit from the right. Thus, consider the following operation: start with every unit square ﬁlled with the number 0. Add 1 to three unit squares, no two in the same row or column. Then add 2 to three unit squares, no two in the same row or column. Finally, add 4 to three unit squares, no two in the same row or column. There are clearly $6^3 = 216$ ways to perform this operation and every such operation results in a unique, suitably ﬁlled-in 3 by 3 square. Hence the answer is 216."
"Fred the Four-Dimensional Fluﬀy Sheep is walking in 4-dimensional space. He starts at the origin. Each minute, he walks from his current position $(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4)$ to some position $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)$ with integer coordinates satisfying $(x_1 - a_1)^2 + (x_2 - a_2)^2 + (x_3 - a_3)^2 + (x_4 - a_4)^2 = 4$ and $|(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4) - (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4)| = 2$. In how many ways can Fred reach (10, 10, 10, 10) after exactly 40 minutes, if he is allowed to pass through this point during his walk?","The possible moves correspond to the vectors $\pm\langle 2, 0, 0, 0 \rangle$, $\pm\langle 1, 1, 1, -1 \rangle$, and their permutations. It’s not hard to see that these vectors form the vertices of a 4-dimensional hypercube, which motivates the change of coordinates $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) \Rightarrow \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4}{2}, \frac{x_1 + x_2 - x_3 - x_4}{2}, \frac{x_1 - x_2 + x_3 - x_4}{2}, \frac{x_1 - x_2 - x_3 + x_4}{2} \right)$. Under this change of coordinates, Fred must travel from (0, 0, 0, 0) to (20, 0, 0, 0), and the possible moves correspond to the sixteen vectors $\langle \pm 1, \pm 1, \pm 1, \pm 1 \rangle$. The new $x_1$-coordinate must increase 30 times and decrease 10 times during Fred’s walk, while the other coordinates must increase 20 times and decrease 20 times. Therefore, there are $\binom{40}{10}\binom{40}{20}^3$ possible walks."
Let $d$ be a real number such that every non-degenerate quadrilateral has at least two interior angles with measure less than $d$ degrees. What is the minimum possible value for $d$?,"The sum of the internal angles of a quadrilateral is $360^\circ$. To find the minimum $d$, we note the limiting case where three of the angles have measure $d$ and the remaining angle has measure approaching zero. Hence, $d \ge 360^\circ/3 = 120^\circ$. It is not difficult to see that for any $0 < \alpha < 120^\circ$, a quadrilateral of which three angles have measure $\alpha$ degrees and fourth angle has measure $(360 - 3\alpha)$ degrees can be constructed."

Given that BF and DE separate ABCD into three polygons with equal area, and that EF = 1, find the length of BD.","Observe that AECF is a parallelogram. The equal area condition gives that $BE = DF = 1$. Let $CE \cap BD = X$, then $BX^2 = EX \cdot CX = 3EX^2 \implies BX = \sqrt{3}EX$, so that $\angle EBX = 30^\circ$. Now, $CE = 2BE = CF$, so CEF is an equilateral triangle and $CD = \sqrt{3}$. Hence, $BD = 2\sqrt{3}$."
"Let AB be a line segment with length 2, and S be the set of points P on the plane such that there exists point X on segment AB with AX = 2PX. Find the area of S.","Observe that for any X on segment AB, the locus of all points P such that AX = 2PX is a circle centered at X with radius $\frac{1}{2}AX$. Note that the point P on this circle where PA forms the largest angle with AB is where PA is tangent to the circle at P, such that $\angle PAB = \arcsin(1/2) = 30^\circ$. Therefore, if we let Q and Q\' be the tangent points of the tangents from A to the circle centered at B (call it $\omega$) with radius $\frac{1}{2}AB$, we have that S comprises the two 30-60-90 triangles AQB and AQ\'B, each with area $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and the $240^\circ$ sector of $\omega$ bounded by BQ and BQ\' with area $\frac{2}{3}\pi$.

"Convex hexagon ABCDEF is drawn in the plane such that ACDF and ABDE are parallelograms with area 168. AC and BD intersect at G. Given that the area of AGB is 10 more than the area of CGB, find the smallest possible area of hexagon ABCDEF.","Since ACDF and ABDE have area 168, triangles ABD and ACD (which are each half a parallelogram) both have area 84. Thus, B and C are the same height away from AD, and since ABCDEF is convex, B and C are on the same side of AD. Thus, BC is parallel to AD, and ABCD is a trapezoid. In particular, we have that the area of ABG equals the area of CDG. Letting this quantity be $x$, we have that the area of BCG is $x - 10$, and the area of ADG is $84 - x$. Then notice that $\frac{[ABG]}{[CBG]} = \frac{AG}{CG} = \frac{[ADG]}{[CDG]}$. This means that $\frac{x}{x-10} = \frac{84-x}{x}$. Simplifying, we have $x^2 - 47x + 420 = 0$; this has solutions $x = 12$ and $x = 35$. The area of ABCDEF is twice the area of trapezoid ABCD, or $2[x + (x - 10) + (84 - x) + x] = 4x + 148$; choosing $x = 12$, we get that the smallest possible area is $48 + 148 = 196$."

Thus $BC = BD = \sqrt{2}$ by the Pythagorean Theorem on $\triangle DBO$. Then $\angle BOC = 90^\circ$, and the distance from O to BC is $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$. Depending on whether A is on the same side of BC as O, the height from A to BC is either $1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ or $1 - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.

Find $R - r$.","The minimal configuration occurs when the six circles are placed with their centers at the vertices of a regular hexagon of side length 2. This gives a radius of 3. The maximal configuration occurs when four of the circles are placed at the vertices of a square of side length 2. Letting these circles be $C_1, C_3, C_4, C_6$ in order, we place the last two so that $C_2$ is tangent to $C_1$ and $C_3$ and $C_5$ is tangent to $C_4$ and $C_6$.

Using the formula $R = \frac{abc}{4A}$, we can find that the circumradius of triangle ABC is $\frac{65}{8}$. The circumradius of the anticomplementary triangle is double of that, so the answer is $\frac{65}{4}$."

We are given N lies on BC, and we also know N lies on the perpendicular bisector of EF, where E is the midpoint of AC and F is the midpoint of AB. The main observation is that N is equidistant from M and F, where M is the midpoint of BC.  Viewing triangle ABC with BC = 1 as the base, the height is $\frac{12}{7}$.

Then Q and R both have z-coordinate 49, so Q$(\frac{49}{k} - 6, 6, 49)$ and R$(6, \frac{49}{k} - 6, 49)$. The equation $PQ^2 = QR^2 = RS^2$ then gives k=7. The area is $\frac{\sqrt{141}}{2}$."

Find the maximum possible value of $S(x + 2019) - S(x)$.,"We note that $S(a + b) \le S(a) + S(b)$ for all positive $a$ and $b$, since carrying over will only decrease the sum of digits. Hence we have $S(x + 2019) - S(x) \le S(2019) = 12$, and equality can be achieved with $x = 100000$ for example."
"Tessa has a figure created by adding a semicircle of radius 1 on each side of an equilateral triangle with side length 2, with semicircles oriented outwards. She then marks two points on the boundary of the figure. What is the greatest possible distance between the two points?","Note that both points must be in different semicircles to reach the maximum distance. Let these points be $M$ and $N$, and $O_1$ and $O_2$ be the centers of the two semicircles where they lie respectively. Then $MN \le MO_1 + O_1O_2 + O_2N$. Note that the right side will always be equal to 3 ($MO_1 = O_2N = 1$ from the radius condition, and $O_1O_2 = 1$ from being a midline of the equilateral triangle), hence $MN$ can be at most 3. Finally, if the four points are collinear, then equality will hold. Therefore, the greatest possible distance between $M$ and $N$ is 3."
Call a positive integer $n$ weird if $n$ does not divide $(n-2)!$. Determine the number of weird numbers between 2 and 100 inclusive.,"We claim that all the weird numbers are all the prime numbers and 4. Since no numbers between 1 and $p - 2$ divide prime $p$, $(p - 2)!$ will not be divisible by $p$. We also have $2! = 2$ not being a multiple of 4. Now we show that all other numbers are not weird. If $n = pq$ where $p \ne q$ and $p, q \ge 2$, then since $p$ and $q$ both appear in $1, 2, ..., n - 2$ and are distinct, we have $pq | (n - 2)!$. This leaves the only case of $n = p^2$ for prime $p \ge 3$. In this case, we can note that $p$ and $2p$ are both less than $p^2 - 2$, so $2p^2 | (n - 2)!$ and we are similarly done. Since there are 25 prime numbers not exceeding 100, there are $25 + 1 = 26$ weird numbers."

The same is true of $x$ and $y$. However, this shows that $x + y$ cannot be 0, so $z$ can only be 4037 or -1. The same is true of $x$ and $y$. Now note that, if any two of $x, y, z$ are -1, then the third one must be 4037. Furthermore, if any one of $x, y, z$ is 4037, then the other two must be -1. Thus, the only possibility is to have exactly two of $x, y, z$ be -1 and the third one be 4037. This means that the only remaining triples are $(-1, -1, 4037)$ and its permutations. These all work, so there are exactly 3 ordered triples."

Since $r$ is nonzero, $r+1 \neq 0$, so $(r+1)^3 = 1$, which gives $r+1 = 1$, so $r=0$ or $r+1 = \omega$ or $r+1 = \omega^2$, where $\omega = e^{i2\pi/3}$ is a cube root of unity.  Since $r$ is a nonzero real number, we must have $r = -1$. Therefore, the value is $\boxed{-1}$."

Thus, either P is the intersection of AB and $\ell$, or P lies on the circle centered at A with radius AB, or P lies on the circle centered at B with radius AB. Each circle-line intersection has at most two solutions, and the line-line intersection has at most one, giving 5.

Since A and B are digits, $A=1, B=11$ is impossible. Then $A=2, B=22$ is impossible. Therefore, there is no solution.  $110A + B = 11B$, so $110A = 10B$, which means $11A = B$. Since A and B are digits, we must have $A=1$, $B=11$ which is not possible, so there is no solution. $A \cdot (10A + B) + B = 11B$, so $10A^2 + AB + B = 11B$, $10A^2 + AB = 10B$, $10A^2 = 10B - AB$, $10A^2 = B(10-A)$.

Let $N$ denote the number of distinct sets $S_\pi$ as $\pi$ ranges over all such permutations. Determine, in terms of $n$, the maximum value of $N$ over all possible values of $a_1, \dots, a_n$.","The answer is $2^n - n$. Let $D = (d_{ij})$ be the matrix where $d_{ij}$ is 1 if $i$ is a divisor of $a_j$ and 0 otherwise. For a subset $S$ of $[n]$, let $D_S$ be the matrix obtained from $D$ by flipping ($0 \leftrightarrow 1$) every entry $d_{ij}$ where $j \notin S$. Observe that $S = S_\pi$ if and only if $(D_S)_{\pi(i)i} = 1$ for all $i$. To show that $N \le 2^n - n$ we consider two cases. If all the rows of $D$ are distinct, then there exist $n$ different possibilities for $S$ that set a row equal to zero. In this case, there is clearly no $\pi$ so that $S_\pi = S$. Thus there are at most $2^n - n$ possible $S_\pi$. Otherwise, if two rows in $D$ are the same, then choose an $S_0$ such that $D_{S_0}$ has two zero rows. Then, the $n+1$ sets $S$ that are at most “one element away” from $S_0$ are such that $D_S$ only has one column with nonzero entries in those two rows. This makes it impossible for $S_\pi = S$ as well, so $N \le 2^n - n - 1$. Now we construct $N = 2^n - n$ by setting $a_j = j$. By Hall’s marriage theorem, it suffices to prove the following: Assuming that $D_S$ has no completely-zero rows, given a set $I = \{i_1, i_2, \dots, i_k\}$ there exist at least $k$ values of $j$ so that there exists an $i \in I$ so that $(D_S)_{ij} = 1$. Call such $j$ admissible. Without loss of generality assume $i_1 < i_2 < \dots < i_k$. Note that if $\{d_{ij} \mid i \in I\} = \{0, 1\}$, then $j$ is admissible. Therefore the $k-1$ numbers $i_1, i_2, \dots, i_{k-1}$ are admissible, since for $\alpha < k$, $i_\alpha$ divides $i_\alpha$ but $i_k$ does not. So we only need to find one more admissible $j$. Assume that $i_k$ is not admissible; now it must be the case that all the $i_\alpha$ are divisors of $i_k$. At this point we note that the $k=1$ case is easy, since no row of $D_S$ is zero. Moreover, if $k=2$, $\{(D_S)_{i_1i_1}, (D_S)_{i_2i_1}\} = \{0, 1\}$, so in the row with the zero there must be 1 somewhere, yielding a second admissible column. In the case where $k \ge 3$, note that $i_1 \le i_k/3$. Therefore $i_k - i_1 \notin I$, but $i_1$ divides $i_k - i_1$ and $i_k$ does not. Thus we have found the last admissible column. Having exhausted all cases, we are done.$"
How many ways can the vertices of a cube be colored red or blue so that the color of each vertex is the color of the majority of the three vertices adjacent to it?,"If all vertices of the cube are of the same color, then there are 2 ways. Otherwise, look at a red vertex. Since it must have at least 2 red neighbors, there is a face of the cube containing 3 red vertices. The last vertex on this face must also be red. Similarly, all vertices on the opposite face must be blue. Thus, all vertices on one face of the cube are red while the others are blue. Since a cube has 6 faces, the answer is 2 + 6 = 8."
"How many positive integers at most 420 leave different remainders when divided by each of 5, 6, and 7?","Note that 210 = 5 \cdot 6 \cdot 7 and 5, 6, 7 are pairwise relatively prime. So, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can just consider the remainders $n$ leaves when divided by each of 5, 6, 7. To construct an $n$ that leaves distinct remainders, first choose its remainder modulo 5, then modulo 6, then modulo 7. We have 5 choices for each remainder. Finally, we multiply by 2 because 420 = 2 \cdot 210. The answer is $2 \cdot 5^3 = 250$."
"Each unit square of a 4 × 4 square grid is colored either red, green, or blue. Over all possible colorings of the grid, what is the maximum possible number of L-trominos that contain exactly one square of each color?","Notice that in each 2 × 2 square contained in the grid, we can form 4 L-trominoes. By the pigeonhole principle, some color appears twice among the four squares, and there are two trominoes which contain both. Therefore each 2 × 2 square contains at most 2 L-trominoes with distinct colors. Equality is achieved by coloring a square $(x, y)$ red if $x + y$ is even, green if $x$ is odd and $y$ is even, and blue if $x$ is even and $y$ is odd. Since there are nine 2 × 2 squares in our 4 × 4 grid, the answer is $9 \times 2 = 18$."
"Given an 8 × 8 checkerboard with alternating white and black squares, how many ways are there to choose four black squares and four white squares so that no two of the eight chosen squares are in the same row or column?","Number both the rows and the columns from 1 to 8, and say that black squares are the ones where the rows and columns have the same parity. We will use, e.g. “even rows” to refer to rows 2, 4, 6, 8. Choosing 8 squares all in different rows and columns is equivalent to matching rows to columns. For each of the 8 rows, we first decide whether they will be matched with a column of the same parity as itself (resulting in a black square) or with one of a different parity (resulting in a white square). Since we want to choose 4 squares of each color, the 4 rows matched to same-parity columns must contain 2 even rows and 2 odd rows. There are $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to choose 2 odd rows and 2 even rows to match with same-parity columns. After choosing the above, we have fixed which 4 rows should be matched with odd columns (while the other 4 should be matched with even columns). Then there are $(4!)^2 = 24^2$ ways to assign the columns to the rows, so the answer is $(6 \cdot 24)^2 = 144^2 = 20736$."
"Let $S$ be a set of intervals defined recursively as follows: \begin{itemize} \item Initially, $[1, 1000]$ is the only interval in $S$. \item If $l \neq r$ and $[l, r] \in S$, then both $[\frac{l}{2}, \frac{l+r}{2}]$ and $[\frac{l+r}{2} + 1, r] \in S$. \end{itemize} (Note that $S$ can contain intervals such as $[1, 1]$, which contain a single integer.) An integer $i$ is chosen uniformly at random from the range $[1, 1000]$. What is the expected number of intervals in $S$ which contain $i$? ","The answer is given by computing the sum of the lengths of all intervals in $S$ and dividing this value by 1000, where the length of an interval $[i, j]$ is given by $j - i + 1$. An interval may be categorized based on how many times $[1, 1000]$ must be split to attain it. An interval that is derived from splitting $[1, 1000]$ $k$ times will be called a $k$-split. The only 0-split is $[1, 1000]$, with a total length of 1000. The 1-splits are $[1, 500]$ and $[501, 1000]$, with a total length of 1000. As long as none of the $k$-splits have length 1, the $(k + 1)$-splits will have the same total length. Since the length of the intervals is reduced by half each time (rounded down), we find that the sum of the lengths of the $k$-splits is 1000 for $0 \le k \le 9$. Note that the 9-splits consist of $2^{10} - 1000$ intervals of length 1 and $1000 - 2^9$ intervals of length 2. Then the 10-splits consist of $2(1000 - 2^9)$ intervals of length 1, with total length $2(1000 - 2^9)$. The total interval length across all splits is equal to $12(1000) - 2^{10}$, so our answer is $12 - \frac{2^{10}}{1000} = 10.976$."
"Alice writes 1001 letters on a blackboard, each one chosen independently and uniformly at random from the set $S = \{a, b, c\}$. A move consists of erasing two distinct letters from the board and replacing them with the third letter in $S$. What is the probability that Alice can perform a sequence of moves which results in one letter remaining on the blackboard?","Let $n_a, n_b,$ and $n_c$ be the number of a’s, b’s, and c’s on the board, respectively. The key observation is that each move always changes the parity of all three of $n_a, n_b,$ and $n_c$. Since the final configuration must have $n_a, n_b,$ and $n_c$ equal to 1, 0, 0 in some order, Alice cannot leave one letter on the board if $n_a, n_b,$ and $n_c$ start with the same parity (because then they will always have the same parity). Alice also cannot leave one letter on the board if all the letters are initially the same (because she will have no moves to make). We claim that in all other cases, Alice can make a sequence of moves leaving one letter on the board. The proof is inductive: the base cases $n_a + n_b + n_c \le 2$ are easy to verify, as the possible tuples are $(1, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0),$ and permutations. If $n_a + n_b + n_c \ge 3$, assume without loss of generality that $n_a \ge n_b \ge n_c$. Then $n_b \ge 1$ (because otherwise all the letters are a) and $n_a \ge 2$ (because otherwise $(n_a, n_b, n_c) = (1, 1, 1)$, which all have the same parity). Then Alice will replace a and b by c, reducing to a smaller case. We begin by computing the probability that $n_a, n_b,$ and $n_c$ start with the same parity. Suppose $m$ letters are chosen at random in the same way (so that we are in the case $m = 1001$). Let $x_m$ be the probability that $n_a, n_b,$ and $n_c$ all have the same parity. We have the recurrence $x_{m+1} = \frac{1}{3}(1 - x_m)$ because when when choosing the $(m + 1)$th letter, the $n_i$ can only attain the same parity if they did not before, and the appropriate letter is drawn. Clearly $x_0 = 1$, which enables us to compute $x_m = \frac{4}{3^{m+1}}(1 + 3 \cdot (-3)^{-m})$. Then $x_{1001}$ is the probability that $n_a, n_b,$ and $n_c$ have the same parity. The probability that all the letters are initially the same is $3^{-1000}$, as this occurs exactly when all the subsequent letters match the first. Thus our final answer is $1 - 3^{-1000} - \frac{1}{4}(1 + 3 \cdot (-3)^{-1001}) = \frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{4} \cdot 3^{-999}$."
"Let $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ be concentric circles with radii 1 and 2, respectively. Four points are chosen on the circumference of $\Gamma_2$ independently and uniformly at random, and are then connected to form a convex quadrilateral. What is the probability that the perimeter of this quadrilateral intersects $\Gamma_1$?","Define a triplet as three points on $\Gamma_2$ that form the vertices of an equilateral triangle. Note that due to the radii being 1 and 2, the sides of a triplet are all tangent to $\Gamma_1$. Rather than choosing four points on $\Gamma_2$ uniformly at random, we will choose four triplets of $\Gamma_2$ uniformly at random and then choose a random point from each triplet. (This results in the same distribution.) Assume without loss of generality that the first step creates 12 distinct points, as this occurs with probability 1. In the set of twelve points, a segment between two of those points does not intersect $\Gamma_1$ if and only if they are at most three vertices apart. There are two possibilities for the perimeter of the convex quadrilateral to not intersect $\Gamma_1$: either the convex quadrilateral contains $\Gamma_1$ or is disjoint from it. Case 1: The quadrilateral contains $\Gamma_1$. Each of the four segments of the quadrilateral passes at most three vertices, so the only possibility is that every third vertex is chosen. There are 3 such quadrilaterals. Case 2: The quadrilateral does not contain $\Gamma_1$. In this case, all of the chosen vertices are at most three apart. This is only possible if we choose four consecutive vertices. There are 12 such quadrilaterals. Regardless of how the triplets are chosen, there are 81 ways to pick four points and $12 + 3 = 15$ of these choices result in a quadrilateral whose perimeter does not intersect $\Gamma_1$. The desired probability is $1 - \frac{15}{81} = \frac{22}{27}$."
"Let DIAL, F OR, and F RIEN D be regular polygons in the plane. If ID = 1, find the product of all possible areas of OLA.","Focusing on F RIEN D and F OR first, observe that either DIO is an equilateral triangle or O is the midpoint of ID. Next, OLA is always an isosceles triangle with base LA = 1. The possible distances of O from LA are 1 and $1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ as the distance from O to ID in the equilateral triangle case is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. The three possibilities are shown in the diagram as shaded triangles $\triangle O_1L_1A_1$, $\triangle O_2L_2A_2$, and $\triangle O_1L_2A_2$. The product of all possible areas is thus $\left(\frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{1 - \sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \left(\frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{16} = \frac{1}{32}$."

What is the side length of hexagon U V W XY Z?","Let the side length of U V W XY Z be $s$. We have W Z = 2s and W Z \parallel AB by properties of regular hexagons. Thus, triangles W CZ and ACB are similar. AW V is an equilateral triangle, so we have AW = s. Thus, using similar triangles, we have $\frac{WC}{WZ} = \frac{AC}{AB} \implies \frac{8-s}{2s} = \frac{8}{5}$, so $5(8 - s) = 8(2s) \implies s = \frac{40}{21}$."
"Let ABCD be a rectangle and E be a point on segment AD. We are given that quadrilateral BCDE has an inscribed circle $\omega_1$ that is tangent to BE at T .

Let AX = AY = r, EX = ET = ER = a, BY = BT = BS = b. Then noting that RS \parallel CD, we see that ABSR is a rectangle, so $r + 2a = b$. Therefore AE = a + r, AB = b + r = 2(a + r), and so BE = b + a = r + 3a. This implies that $a = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}r$. The desired ratio is then $\frac{BE}{2AY} = \frac{AB}{2r} = \frac{a+r}{r} = \frac{3+\sqrt{5}}{2}$."

Compute the area of the circumcircle of DEF .","Let I be the incenter of ABC. We claim that I is the circumcenter of DEF . Let the incircle touch AB, BC, and AC at X, Y , and Z, respectively. Noting that XB = BY = 2, YC = CZ = 4, and ZA = AX = 3, we see that XD = YE = ZF = 9. Thus, since IX = IY = IZ = r (where r is the inradius) and $\angle IXD = \angle IYE = \angle IZF = 90^\circ$, we have three congruent right triangles, and so ID = IE = IF , as desired. Let $s = 5+6+7/2 = 9$ be the semiperimeter. By Heron’s formula, $[ABC] = \sqrt{9(9-5)(9-6)(9-7)} = 6\sqrt{6}$, so $r = \frac{[ABC]}{s} = \frac{6\sqrt{6}}{9} = \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3}$.

Find the measure of angle $\angle ACB$.,"By inscribed angles, we know that $\angle BAC = 38^\circ \cdot 2 = 76^\circ$ which means that $\angle C = 104^\circ - \angle B$. Since AM = AC, we have $\angle ACM = \angle AMC = 90^\circ - \angle MAC = 71^\circ$. Once again by inscribed angles, this means that $\angle B = 71^\circ$ which gives $\angle C = 33^\circ$."

Two sides of a regular n-gon are extended to meet at a $28^\circ$ angle. What is the smallest possible value for n?,"We note that if we inscribe the n-gon in a circle, then according to the inscribed angle theorem, the angle between two sides is $\frac{1}{2}$ times some x - y, where x and y are integer multiples of the arc measure of one side of the n-gon. Thus, the angle is equal to $\frac{2 \cdot k \cdot 360}{n} = 28$ for some integer k. Simplifying gives $7n = 45k$, and since all k are clearly attainable, the smallest possible value of n is 45."

"Estimate $N$, the expected number of moves the snake makes before it has no legal moves remaining.","Let $n = 30$. The snake can get stuck in only 8 positions, while the total number of positions is about $n^2 \times 4 \times 3 \times 3 = 36n^2$. We can estimate the answer as $\frac{36n^2}{8} = 4050$, which is good enough for 13 points. Let’s try to compute the answer as precisely as possible. For each head position $(a, b)$ and tail orientation $c \in [0, 36)$, let $x = 36(na + b) + c$ be an integer denoting the current state of the snake. Let $E_x$ be the expected number of moves the snake makes if it starts at state $x$. If from state $x$ the snake can transition to any of states $y_1, y_2, \dots, y_k$, then add an equation of the form $E_x - \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k E_{y_i} = 1$. Otherwise, if there are no transitions out of state $x$ then set $E_x = 0$. It suffices to solve a system of $36n^2$ linear equations for $E_0, E_1, \dots, E_{36n^2 - 1}$. Then the answer will equal $E_i$, where $i$ corresponds to the state described in the problem statement. Naively, using Gaussian elimination would require about $(36n^2)^3 \approx 3.4 \cdot 10^{13}$ operations, which is too slow. Also, it will require too much memory to store $(36n^2)^2$ real numbers at once. We can use the observation that initially, the maximum difference between any two indices within the same equation is at most $\approx 72n$, so Gaussian elimination only needs to perform approximately $(36n^2) \cdot (72n)^2 \approx 1.5 \cdot 10^{11}$ operations. Furthermore, we’ll only need to store $\approx (36n^2) \cdot (72n)$ real numbers at a time. Benjamin Qi’s solution ends up finishing in less than two minutes for $n = 30$ (C++ code)."
Compute the sum of all positive integers $n$ for which the expression $n + 7\sqrt{n-1}$ is an integer.,"We know that $\sqrt{n-1}$ cannot be a non-integer rational. Thus, $n-1$ must be a perfect square. Then we have $n + 7\sqrt{n-1} = n - 1 + 7\sqrt{n-1} + 1 = (\sqrt{n-1} + 7)\sqrt{n-1} + 1$. Since $n + 7\sqrt{n-1}$ is an integer, $\sqrt{n-1}$ must be an integer. Let $k = \sqrt{n-1}$, so $n = k^2 + 1$. Then $n + 7\sqrt{n-1} = k^2 + 1 + 7k$ is an integer. Since $k^2 + 1 + 7k$ is an integer, we need only require that $k$ is an integer.  Since the expression must be an integer, $n-1$ must be a perfect square. Therefore, $n-1$ must be a perfect square that divides $8$. The perfect squares that divide 8 are 1 and 4. Thus, $n-1 \in \{1, 4\}$, so $n \in \{2, 5\}$. $n-1$ must be a perfect square that divides 8. The perfect squares dividing 8 are 1 and 4, which give n = 2 and n = 5.  Then $2 + 7\sqrt{2-1} = 9$ and $5 + 7\sqrt{5-1} = 17$. The expression is also an integer for $n=17$ and $n=65$. Therefore the sum of all such $n$ is $2 + 5 + 17 + 65 = 89$."
"Among all polynomials $P(x)$ with integer coefficients for which $P(-10) = 145$ and $P(9) = 164$, compute the smallest possible value of $|P(0)|$.","Since $a-b|P(a) - P(b)$ for any integer polynomial $P$ and integers $a$ and $b$, we have $19|P(-10) - P(9) = 145 - 164 = -19$, which is always true. We require that $10|P(0) - P(-10)$ and $9|P(0) - P(9)$. Thus, $P(0) \equiv 145 \pmod{10}$ and $P(0) \equiv 164 \pmod{9}$. This simplifies to $P(0) \equiv 5 \pmod{10}$ and $P(0) \equiv 1 \pmod{9}$.

If $P(1, 2, 3) = 1$, compute $P(2, 4, 8)$.","Since $P(a, a, b) = 0$, $(x - y)$ is a factor of $P$. By symmetry, $(y - z)$ and $(z - x)$ are also factors. Thus, $P(x, y, z) = (x - y)(y - z)(z - x)Q(x, y, z)$, where $Q(x, y, z)$ is a symmetric homogeneous degree 1 polynomial. Then $Q(x, y, z) = k(x + y + z)$ for some real constant $k$.  Therefore, $P(x, y, z) = k(x - y)(y - z)(z - x)(x + y + z)$. We are given that $P(1, 2, 3) = 1$, so $k(1 - 2)(2 - 3)(3 - 1)(1 + 2 + 3) = 1$, which gives $-12k = 1$, so $k = -\frac{1}{12}$.

He then computes the sum of the numbers in the 13 squares that are the same color as the center square. Compute the maximum possible sum Leo can obtain.","Since consecutive numbers are in adjacent squares and the grid squares alternate in color, consecutive numbers must be in squares of opposite colors. Then the odd numbers 1, 3, 5, ..., 25 all share the same color while the even numbers 2, 4, ..., 24 all share the opposite color. Since we have 13 odd numbers and 12 even numbers, the odd numbers must correspond to the color in the center square, so Leo’s sum is always $1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + 25 = 169$. "
"Ava and Tiffany participate in a knockout tournament consisting of a total of 32 players. In each of 5 rounds, the remaining players are paired uniformly at random.

Therefore, the probability that Ava and Tiffany form one of the 31 pairs of players that play each other is $\frac{31}{496} = \frac{31}{32 \cdot 31/2} = \frac{1}{16}$, giving an answer of $100 \cdot 1 + 16 = 116$."

Compute the number of functions $f : S \to S$ such that, for all $s \in S$, $f(f(f(s))) = s$ and $f(s) - s$ is not divisible by 3.","Since $f(f(f(s))) = s$ for all $s \in S$, each cycle in the cycle decomposition of $f$ must have length 1 or 3. Also, since $f(s) \not\equiv s \pmod{3}$ for all $s \in S$, each cycle cannot contain two elements $a, b$ such that $a \equiv b \pmod{3}$. Hence each cycle has exactly three elements, one from each of residue classes mod 3. In particular, 1, 4, 7 belong to distinct cycles. There are $6 \cdot 3$ ways to choose two other numbers in the cycle containing 1. Then, there are $4 \cdot 2$ ways to choose two other numbers in the cycle containing 4.

We first show that any optimal set is either of the form $\{b, b + 1, b + 2, \dots, d\}$ or $\{b, b + 1, \dots, d\} \setminus \{c\}$, for some $b < c < d$. Without loss of generality, assume that the sequence $a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n$ has the maximum product. Suppose $a_{j+1} > a_j + 2$. Then, increasing $a_j$ by 1 and decreasing $a_{j+1}$ by 1 will increase the product M, contradicting the assumption that the sequence has the optimal product. Thus, any ”gaps” in the $a_i$ can only have size 1. Now, we show that there can only be one such gap. Suppose $a_{j+1} = a_j + 2$, and $a_{k+1} = a_k + 2$, for $j < k$. Then, we can increase $a_j$ by 1 and decrease $a_{i+1}$ by 1 to increase the total product. Thus, there is at most one gap, and the sequence $a_i$ is of one of the forms described before. We now show that either $b = 2$ or $b = 3$. Consider any set of the form $\{b, b + 1, b + 2, \dots, d\}$ or $\{b, b + 1, \dots, d\} \setminus \{c\}$. If $b = 1$, then we can remove $b$ and increase $d$ by 1 to increase the product. If $b > 4$, then we can remove $b$ and replace it with 2 and $b - 2$ to increase the product. Thus, we have $b = 2$, 3, or 4. Suppose $b = 4$. If the next element is 5, we can replace it with a 2 and a 3 to increase the product, and if the next element is 6, we can replace it with a 1, 2, and 3 without making the product any smaller. Thus, we can assume that either $b = 2$ or $b = 3$. The nearest triangular number to 2021 is $2016 = 1 + 2 + \dots + 64$. Using this, we can compute that if $b = 2$, our set must be $\{2, 3, \dots, 64\} \setminus \{58\}$, leading to a product of $\frac{64!}{58}$. If $b = 3$, our set is $\{3, \dots, 64\} \setminus \{56\}$, leading to a product of $\frac{64!}{2 \cdot 56}$. Thus, the maximum product is $\frac{64!}{58}$. We now compute the highest power of 2 that divides this expression. 64! includes 32 elements that contribute at least one power of 2, 16 that contribute at least two powers of 2, and so on until the one element that contributes at least six powers of 2. This means the highest power of 2 that divides 64! is $32 + 16 + \dots + 2 + 1 = 63$. Finally, dividing by 58 removes one of these powers of 2, making the answer 62."

So, the probability that the second-best team survives every round before the last round is $\prod_{k=3}^{2021} \frac{(k+1)(k-2)}{k(k-1)}$, which telescopes to $\frac{2022!}{3!} \frac{2!}{2021!} \frac{2019!}{0!} \frac{1!}{2020!} = \frac{2022}{2020} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{337}{1010} = p$.

"In triangle ABC, $\angle A = 2\angle C$. Suppose that AC = 6, BC = 8, and AB = $\sqrt{a - b}$, where a and b are positive integers. Compute $100a + b$.","Let x = AB, and $\angle C = \theta$, then $\angle A = 2\theta$ and $\angle B = 180 - 3\theta$. Extend ray BA to D so that AD = AC. We know that $\angle CAD = 180 - 2\theta$, and since $\triangle ADC$ is isosceles, it follows that $\angle ADC = \angle ACD = \theta$, and so $\angle DCB = 2\theta = \angle BAC$, meaning that $\triangle BAC \sim \triangle BCD$. Therefore, we have $\frac{x}{6} = \frac{8}{x+6} \implies x(x+6) = 48 \implies x^2 + 6x - 48 = 0$. Since x > 0, we have $x = -3 + \sqrt{57}$. So $100a + b = 7303$."
"Two circles $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ of radius 1 and 2, respectively, are centered at the origin. A particle is placed at (2, 0) and is shot towards $\Gamma_1$. When it reaches $\Gamma_1$, it bounces off the circumference and heads back towards $\Gamma_2$. The particle continues bouncing off the two circles in this fashion. If the particle is shot at an acute angle $\theta$ above the x-axis, it will bounce 11 times before returning to (2, 0) for the first time. If $\cot \theta = \frac{a}{b}$ for positive integers a and b, compute $100a + b$.","By symmetry, the particle must bounce off of $\Gamma_2$ at points that make angles of $60^\circ, 120^\circ, 180^\circ, 240^\circ,$ and $300^\circ$ with the positive x-axis. Similarly, the particle must bounce off of $\Gamma_1$ at points that make angles of $30^\circ, 90^\circ, 150^\circ, 210^\circ, 270^\circ,$ and $330^\circ$ with the positive x-axis. In particular, the first point that the ball touches on $\Gamma_1$ is $(\cos 30^\circ, \sin 30^\circ)$. So, $\cot \theta = \frac{2 - \cos 30^\circ}{\sin 30^\circ} = 4 - \sqrt{3}$."
"Let E be a three-dimensional ellipsoid. For a plane $p$, let $E(p)$ be the projection of $E$ onto the plane $p$. The minimum and maximum areas of $E(p)$ are $9\pi$ and $25\pi$, and there exists a $p$ where $E(p)$ is a circle of area $16\pi$. If $V$ is the volume of $E$, compute $V/\pi$.","Let the three radii of $E$ be $a < b < c$. We know that $ab = 9$ and $bc = 25$. Consider the plane $p$ where projection $E(p)$ has area $9\pi$. Fixing $p$, rotate $E$ on the axis passing through the radius with length $b$ until $E(p)$ has area $25\pi$. The projection onto $p$ will be an ellipse with radii $b$ and $r$, where $r$ increases monotonically from $a$ to $c$. By Intermediate Value Theorem, there must exist a circular projection with radius $b$. As the area of this projection is $16\pi$, $b = 4$.

Let $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ be a strictly increasing function such that $f(1) = 1$ and $f(2n)f(2n + 1) = 9f(n)^2 + 3f(n)$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Compute $f(137)$.,"Plugging in $n = 1$ gives $f(2)f(3) = 12$, therefore $(f(2), f(3)) = (2, 6)$ or $(3, 4)$. However, the former implies $f(4)f(5) \ge (6+1)(6+2) > 42 = 9 \cdot 2^2 + 3 \cdot 2$, which is impossible; therefore $f(2) = 3$ and $f(3) = 4$. We now show by induction with step size 2 that $f(2n) = 3f(n)$ and $f(2n + 1) = 3f(n) + 1$ for all $n$; the base case $n = 1$ has already been proven. Assume the statement is true for $n < 2k$. Applying the given and the inductive hypothesis, we have $f(4k)f(4k + 1) = (3f(2k))(3f(2k) + 1) = (9f(k))(9f(k) + 1)$ $f(4k + 2)f(4k + 3) = (3f(2k + 1))(3f(2k + 1) + 1) = (9f(k) + 3)(9f(k) + 4)$ Let $x = f(4k + 1)$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing, this implies $x \ge \sqrt{f(4k)f(4k + 1)} > 9f(k)$ and $x \le \sqrt{f(4k + 2)f(4k + 3)} - 1 < 9f(k) + 3$. So $x = 9f(k) + 1$ or $x = 9f(k) + 2$. Since $9f(k) + 2$ does not divide $9f(k)(9f(k) + 1)$, we must have $f(4k + 1) = x = 9f(k) + 1$ and $f(4k) = 9f(k)$. A similar argument shows that $f(4k + 2) = 9f(k) + 3$ and $f(4k + 3) = 9f(k) + 4$, and this completes the inductive step. Now it is a straightforward induction to show that $f$ is the function that takes a number’s binary digits and treats it as base 3. Since $137 = 10001001_2$ in binary, $f(137) = 10001001_3 = 3^7 + 3^4 + 1 = 2187 + 81 + 1 = 2269$."
"Let triangle $ABC$ have incircle $\omega$, which touches $BC$, $CA$, and $AB$ at $D$, $E$, and $F$, respectively. Then, let $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ be circles tangent to $AD$ and internally tangent to $\omega$ at $E$ and $F$, respectively. Let $P$ be the intersection of line $EF$ and the line passing through the centers of $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$. If $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ have radii 5 and 6, respectively, compute $PE \cdot PF$.","Let the centers of $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ be $O_1$ and $O_2$. Let $DE$ intersect $\omega_1$ again at $Q$, and let $DF$ intersect $\omega_2$ again at $R$. Note that since $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ must be tangent to $AD$ at the same point (by equal tangents), so $AD$ must be the radical axis of $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$, so $RQEF$ is cyclic. Thus, we have $\angle O_1QR = \angle EQR - \angle O_1QE = 180^\circ - \angle EFD - \angle O_1EQ = 90^\circ$ Thus, we have $QR$ is tangent to $\omega_1$, and similarly it must be tangent to $\omega_2$ as well. Now, note that by Monge’s theorem on $\omega$, $\omega_1$, and $\omega_2$, we have that $P$ must be the intersection of the external tangents of $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$. Since $RQ$ is an external tangent, we have $P$, $Q$, and $R$ are collinear. Thus, by power of a point, we have $PE \cdot PF = PR \cdot PQ$. Note that $PR = 10$ and $PQ = 12$. Thus, we have $PE \cdot PF = 3600.$"
"A set of 6 distinct lattice points is chosen uniformly at random from the set $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}^2$. Let A be the expected area of the convex hull of these 6 points. Estimate $N = \lceil 10^4 A \rceil$.","The main tools we will use are linearity of expectation and Pick’s theorem. Note that the resulting polygon is a lattice polygon, and this the expected area A satisfies $A = I + \frac{B}{2} - 1$, where I is the expected number of interior points and B is the expected number of boundary points. We may now use linearity of expectation to write this as $A = -1 + \sum_{p \in \{1,2,...,6\}^2} E[X_p]$ where $X_p$ is 1 if the point is inside the polygon, 1/2 if the point is on the boundary, and 0 otherwise. Letting $f(p) = E[X_p]$, we may write this by symmetry as $A = -1 + 4f(1, 1) + 8f(1, 2) + 8f(1, 3) + 4f(2, 2) + 8f(2, 3) + 4f(3, 3)$. There are many ways to continue the estimation from here; we outline one approach. Since $X(1,1)$ is 1/2 if and only if $(1, 1)$ is one of the selected points (and 0 otherwise), we see $f(1, 1) = \frac{1}{12}$. On the other hand, we may estimate that a central point is exceedingly likely to be within the polygon, and guess $f(3, 3) \approx 1$. We may also estimate $f(1, y)$ for $y \in \{2, 3\}$; such a point is on the boundary if and only if $(1, y)$ is selected or $(1, z)$ is selected for some $z < y$ and for some $z > y$. The first event happens with probability 1/6, and the second event happens with some smaller probability that can be estimated by choosing the 6 points independently (without worrying about them being distinct); this works out to give the slight overestimate $f(1, 2), f(1, 3) \approx \frac{1}{8}$. From here, it is not so clear how to estimate $f(2, 2)$ and $f(2, 3)$, but one way is to make $f(x, y)$ somewhat linear in each component; this works out to give $f(2, 2) \approx \frac{1}{4}$, $f(2, 3) \approx \frac{1}{2}$. (In actuality the estimates we’d get would be slightly higher, but each of our estimates for $f(x, y)$ up until this point have been slight overestimates.) Summing these up gives us an estimate of $A \approx \frac{31}{3}$ or $E = 103333$, which earns 10 points. The actual value of A is 10.4552776..., and so $N = 104552$."
"Let $(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_8)$ be a permutation of $(1, 2, \dots, 8)$. Find, with proof, the maximum possible number of elements of the set $\{a_1, a_1 + a_2, \dots, a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_8\}$ that can be perfect squares.","We claim the maximum is 5, achieved by the sequence $(1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8)$. Now we prove that we cannot do better. Since $a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_8 = 1 + 2 + \dots + 8 = 36$, then there are at most 6 squares in $\{a_1, a_1 + a_2, \dots, a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_8\}$. Note that if $a_1 + \dots + a_k = n^2$ and $a_1 + \dots + a_j = (n + 1)^2$, then $a_{k+1} + \dots + a_j = 2n + 1$. Since $2n + 1$ is odd, $a_m$ must be odd for some $m \in [k + 1, j]$. Thus, if all of 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, and 36 are in $\{a_1, a_1 + a_2, \dots, a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_8\}$, then $a_1 = 1$, and there are five more odd values in $\{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_8\}$, which is a contradiction because there are only four odd numbers in $\{1, 2, \dots, 8\}$."

Since $XY$ is tangent to the incircle, we have $AI$ has length twice the inradius. Thus, we get $\angle A = 60^\circ$. Thus, since $\stackrel{\frown}{XY} = \frac{\angle A}{2} \times 2\pi R = \frac{60}{360} \times 2\pi R = \pi R/3$. Thus, $\stackrel{\frown}{XY}$ is a $120^\circ$ arc. Thus, we have $XY = R \sqrt{3}$."

Let $P(x) = x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + x$ be a polynomial with four distinct roots that lie on a circle in the complex plane. Prove that $ab \ne 9$.,"Let the roots be $0, z_1, z_2, z_3$, and let the circle through these points be $C$.

Thus, the second equation represents the average of three points on $L$, which must be a point on $L$, while the second equation represents the reciprocal of the centroid of $z_1, z_2, z_3$.

These can be checked to work. Now, I will prove that these are the only solutions. Let $P(x, y, z)$ be the assertion of the problem statement. Lemma 1. $f(x) \in \{0, \frac{x^2 - 1}{x}\}$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$. Proof. $P(1, 1, 1)$ yields $f(1) = 0$. Then, $P(x, 1, \frac{1}{x})$ and $P(1, x, \frac{1}{x})$ yield $f(x)^2 = x(x + \frac{1}{x} + 1)(f(x) + f(\frac{1}{x}))$, $-f(x)f(\frac{1}{x}) = (x + \frac{1}{x} + 1)(f(x) + f(\frac{1}{x}))$. Thus, we have $f(x)^2 = -xf(x)f(\frac{1}{x})$, so we have $f(x) = 0$ or $f(\frac{1}{x}) = -\frac{f(x)}{x}$. Plugging in the latter into $f(x)^2 = x(x + \frac{1}{x} + 1)(f(x) - \frac{f(x)}{x})$, which gives us $f(x) = 0$ or $f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x}$. This proves Lemma 1. Lemma 2. If $f(t) = 0$ for some $t \ne 1$, then we have $f(x) = 0$ for all $x$. Proof. $P(x, t, \frac{1}{tx})$ give us $f(x)^2 = x(x + t + \frac{1}{tx})(f(x) + f(t) + f(\frac{1}{tx}))$ and $P(t, x, \frac{1}{tx})$ gives us $-f(x)f(\frac{1}{tx}) = t(x + t + \frac{1}{tx})(f(x) + f(t) + f(\frac{1}{tx}))$. Thus we have $tf(x)^2 = -xf(x)f(\frac{1}{tx})$, so $f(x) = 0$ or $f(\frac{1}{tx}) = -\frac{t}{x}f(x)$. Plugging in the latter into $f(x)^2 = x(x + t + \frac{1}{tx})(f(x) - \frac{t}{x}f(x))$, which gives us either $f(x) = 0$ or $f(x) = x(x + t + \frac{1}{t})$. Note that since $x \ne \frac{x^2-1}{x}$, since $t \ne 1$, we must have that $f(x) = 0$. Thus, we have proved lemma 2. Combining these lemmas finishes the problem."

Compute the sum of all 2-digit prime numbers $p$ such that there exists a prime number $q$ for which $100q + p$ is a perfect square.,"All squares must end with 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9, meaning that $p$ must end with 1 and 9. Moreover, since all odd squares are 1 mod 4, we know that $p$ must be 1 mod 4. This rules out all primes except for 41, 61, 29, 89. Since $17^2 = 289$, $19^2 = 361$, $23^2 = 529$, 89, 61, and 29 all work. To finish, we claim that 41 does not work. If $100q + 41$ were a square, then since all odd squares are 1 mod 8 we find that $4q + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{8}$, implying that $q$ is even. But 241 is not a square, contradiction.

For example, $[-4.5] = -4$ and $\langle 4.35 \rangle = 4.4$.)","Without loss of generality, let $a$ and $b$ have the same integer part or integer parts that differ by at most 1, as we can always repeatedly subtract 1 from the larger number and add 1 to the smaller to get another solution. Next, we note that the decimal part of $a$ must round to .6 and the decimal part of $b$ must round to .3. We note that $(a, b) = (49.55, 49.25)$ is a solution and is clearly minimal in fractional parts, giving us $[10(a + b)] = 988$."
"Regular polygons ICAO, VENTI, and ALBEDO lie on a plane. Given that IN = 1, compute the number of possible values of ON.","First, place ALBEDO. We then note that ICAO has two orientations, both of which have I on EO. Next, we note that for any given orientation of ICAO, the two orientations of VENTI have N symmetric to line EI. Thus, for any given orientation of ICAO, we have that ON is the same in both orientations of VENTI, which gives a total of 2 possible values for ON."
"A jar contains 8 red balls and 2 blue balls. Every minute, a ball is randomly removed. The probability that there exists a time during this process where there are more blue balls than red balls in the jar can be expressed as $\frac{a}{b}$ for relatively prime integers $a$ and $b$. Compute $100a + b$.","One can show that the condition in the problem is satisfied if and only the last ball drown is blue (which happens with probability $\frac{1}{5}$), or the blue balls are drawn second-to-last and third-to-last (which happens with probability $\frac{1}{\binom{10}{2}} \frac{4}{5} = \frac{2}{45}$). Thus the total probability is $\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{45} = \frac{11}{45}$."
"For any positive integer $n$, let $\tau(n)$ denote the number of positive divisors of $n$. If $n$ is a positive integer such that $\frac{\tau(n^2)}{\tau(n)} = 3$, compute $\frac{\tau(n^7)}{\tau(n)}$.","Let the prime factorization of $n$ be $n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$. Then, the problem condition is $\prod_{i=1}^k \frac{2e_i + 1}{e_i + 1} = 3$. Note that since $\frac{2x+1}{x+1} \ge 1$ for $x \ge 0$, and $\frac{3}{2} \times \frac{3}{2} > 3$, we have $k \le 2$. Also, $k = 1$ implies $2e_1 + 1 = 3(e_1 + 1)$, which implies $e_1 = -2$, which is impossible. Thus, we must have $k = 2$. Then, our equation becomes $(2e_1 + 1)(2e_2 + 1) = 3(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)$, which simplifies to $(e_1 - 1)(e_2 - 1) = 2$. This gives us $e_1 = 2$ and $e_2 = 3$, or vice-versa. Thus, we have $n = p^2 q^3$ for primes $p$ and $q$, so $\frac{\tau(n^7)}{\tau(n)} = \frac{\tau(p^{14} q^{21})}{\tau(p^2 q^3)} = \frac{15 \cdot 22}{3 \cdot 4} = 55$."
"The function $f(x)$ is of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$ for some integers $a$, $b$, and $c$.

To start, we observe that since $a \ge 0$ (since the answer to the problem is nonnegative), we must either have $f(858522) \approx 4.39 \cdot 10^{12}$ or $f(177883) \approx 4.39 \cdot 10^{12}$. However, since 858522 is relatively close to 796921, the first case is unrealistic, meaning that the second case must be true. Now, looking mod 2, we find that $f(796921) \approx 1.32 \cdot 10^{12}$. Additionally, we find that mod 5, $f(1) \equiv f(3) \equiv 0 \pmod{5}$, so $f(x) \equiv a(x-1)(x-3) \pmod{5}$. Modulo 5, we now have $\{3a, 4a\} = \{f(0), f(2)\} = \{2, 4\}$, so it follows that $a \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$, $f(349710) \approx 1.78 \cdot 10^{12}$ and $f(858522) \approx 1.98 \cdot 10^{12}$. There are several ways to finish from here. One (somewhat tedious) method is to use mod 9, which tells us that $f(7) = 7$, $f(5) = 8$, $f(3) = 4$, which tells you that $a \equiv 5 \pmod{9}$ (take a finite difference). This tells you that $a \equiv 23 \pmod{45}$, and $a \ge 68$ can be ruled out for being too large. Another method is to work with the numbers themselves. One way to do this is to note that for quadratic polynomials, $f\\prime\\left(\\frac{x+y}{2}\\right) = \\frac{f(y) - f(x)}{y - x}$. Using this for $\{177883, 348710\}$ and $\{796921, 858522\}$, we find that $f\\prime(260000) \approx -1500000$ and $f\\prime(830000) \approx 1000000$. Thus $f\\prime$ (which we know must be linear with slope $2a$) has slope just less than 50. Either way, we find that $a = 23$. The actual polynomial is $8529708870514 - 27370172x + 23x^2$."

Let B\'C\' be a translate of BC (parallel to AB and CD) so that M is the midpoint of B\' and C\'. Since MB\' = MC\' = 25/2 = MP = MQ, B\' and C\' are one of the four intersections of the circle with diameter PQ and the sides AB and CD. We may also define A\' and D\' similarly and get that they are also among the four points. It follows that the desired quadrilateral is B\'D\'C\'A\', which is a rectangle with height equal to the height of ABCD (which is 24), and width equal to $\\frac{1}{2}(31 - 17) = 7$.

"Diana is playing a card game against a computer. She starts with a deck consisting of a single card labeled 0.9. Each turn, Diana draws a random card from her deck, while the computer generates a card with a random real number drawn uniformly from the interval $[0, 1]$.

If we don’t lose it after the first turn, which happens with probability $x$, then given this, the expected number of turns this card contributes is $f(x) + 1$. Thus, we can write the equation $f(x) = 1 + xf(x) + \\int_0^x f(t)dt$. Differentiating both sides gives us $f\'(x) = xf\'(x) + f(x) + f(x) \\implies \\frac{f\'(x)}{f(x)} = \\frac{2}{1 - x}$. Integrating gives us $\ln f(x) = -2 \ln(1 - x) + C \\implies f(x) = C(1 - x)^{-2}$. Since $f(0) = 1$, we know that $C = 1$, so $f(x) = (1 - x)^{-2}$. Thus, we have $f(0.9) = (1 - 0.9)^{-2} = 100$."

Claim: The sum in the problem is equal to the number of solutions of $2x + 3y \le 300$ where $x, y$ are positive integers. Proof. The sum in the problem is the same as counting the number of triples $(a, b, d)$ of positive integers such that $\gcd(a, b) = 1$ and $d(2a + 3b) \le 300$. Now, given such $(a, b, d)$, we biject it to the pair $(x, y)$ described in the claim by $x = da$ and $x = db$. This transformation can be reversed by $d = \gcd(x, y)$, $a = x/d$, and $b = y/d$, implying that it is indeed a bijection, so the sum is indeed equal to the number of such $(x, y)$. Hence, we wish to count the number of positive integer solutions to $2x + 3y \le 300$. One way to do this is via casework on $y$, which we know to be an integer less than 100:  If $y$ is even, then $y = 2k$ for $1 \le k \le 49$. Fixing $k$, there are exactly $\lfloor \frac{300 - 6k}{2} \rfloor = 150 - 3k$ values of $x$ which satisfy the inequality, hence the number of solutions in this case is $\sum_{k=1}^{49} (150 - 3k) = 3675$. If $y$ is odd, then $y = 2k - 1$ for $1 \le k \le 50$. Fixing $y$, there are exactly $\lfloor \frac{302 - 6k}{2} \rfloor = 151 - 3k$ of $x$ which satisfy the inequality, hence the number of solutions in this case is $\sum_{k=1}^{50} (151 - 3k) = 3725$.

Thus, it suffices to count the ways to distribute 10 cards to each player to get exactly 5 blocks. Note that since Yaiza lost, Elbert must have the last block, and since blocks alternate in player, Elbert also has the first block. Then a card distribution is completely determined by where Yaiza’s blocks are relative to Elbert’s cards, as well as the number of cards in each block. Since Elbert has 10 cards, there are $\binom{9}{2}$ ways to pick the locations of the blocks, and $\binom{9}{2}$ ways to distribute 10 cards between two blocks.

If the area of triangle PBC is 20, and the area of triangle PAD is 23, compute the area of hexagon ABCDEF.","If $s$ is the side length of the hexagon, $h_1$ is the length of the height from P to BC, and $h_2$ is the length of the height from P to AD, we have $[PBC] = \frac{1}{2}(2s) \cdot h_1$ and $[PAD] = \frac{1}{2}(2s) \cdot h_2$. We also have $h_1 + h_2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s$. Therefore, $2[PBC] + [PAD] = s(h_1 + h_2) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s^2$. The area of a hexagon with side length $s$ is $\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}s^2$, giving a final answer of $\sqrt{6}[PBC] + 3[PAD] = 6 \cdot 20 + 3 \cdot 23 = 189$."
"Points X, Y, and Z lie on a circle with center O such that XY = 12. Points A and B lie on segment XY such that OA = AZ = ZB = BO = 5. Compute AB.","Let the midpoint of XY be M. Because OAZB is a rhombus, OZ $\perp$ AB, so M is the midpoint of AB as well. Since OM = $\frac{1}{2}$OX, $\triangle OMX$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, and since XM = 6, OM = $2\sqrt{3}$. Since OA = 5, the Pythagorean theorem gives AM = $\sqrt{13}$, so AB = $2\sqrt{13}$."
Suppose ABCD is a rectangle whose diagonals meet at E. The perimeter of triangle ABE is 10π and the perimeter of triangle ADE is n. Compute the number of possible integer values of n.,"For each triangle T, we let $p(T)$ to denote the perimeter of T. First, we claim that $\frac{1}{2}p(\triangle ABE) < p(\triangle ADE) < 2p(\triangle ABE)$. To see why, observe that $p(\triangle ADE) = EA + ED + AD < 2(EA + ED) = 2(EA + EB) < 2p(\triangle ABE)$. Similarly, one can show that $p(\triangle ABE) < 2p(\triangle ADE)$, proving the desired inequality. This inequality limits the possibility of n to only those in $(5\pi, 20\pi) \subset (15.7, 62.9)$, so n could only range from 16, 17, 18, ..., 62, giving 47 values. These values are all achievable because when AD approaches zero, we have $p(\triangle ADE) \to 2EA$ and $p(\triangle ABE) \to 4EA$, implying that $p(\triangle ADE) \to \frac{1}{2}p(\triangle ABE) = 5\pi$; similarly, when AB approaches zero, we have $p(\triangle ADE) \to 2p(\triangle ABE) = 20\pi$; and by continuously rotating segments AC and BD about E, we have that $p(\triangle ADE)$ can reach any value between $(5\pi, 20\pi)$. Hence, the answer is 47."
"Let ABC be a triangle with AB = 13, BC = 14, and CA = 15. Suppose PQRS is a square such that P and R lie on line BC, Q lies on line CA, and S lies on line AB.

Now, let X and M be the midpoints of AA′ and PR. Standard altitude computation gives BX = 5, CX = 9, AX = 12. Moreover, from similar triangles, CX : CY = AA′ : PR = BX : BM, so BM : CM = 5 : 9, so we easily get that BM = 35/2. Now, PM = $\frac{12}{9} \cdot BY = 42$, so the side length is $\frac{42}{\sqrt{2}}$."

Also, we have $\tan \angle ABC = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$.  one can see that $\tan \alpha + \tan \beta + \tan \gamma = \tan \alpha \cdot \tan \beta \cdot \tan \gamma$. Thus we have $\tan \angle ACB + 2 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \tan \angle ACB \cdot 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$. Also, for any angles $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ summing to $180^\circ$, we have $\tan \alpha + \tan \beta + \tan \gamma = \tan \alpha \cdot \tan \beta \cdot \tan \gamma$, so $\tan \angle ACB = 8 + 5\sqrt{3}$."

Then, $100 = 100a_1 + 100(a_2 + \dots + a_{100})$, so $1 = a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{100}$.  Then $(a_1 - 50)^2 + (a_2 - 50)^2 + \dots + (a_{100} - 50)^2 = 2500$.  Thus $(a_1 - 50)^2 \le 2500$, which means $|a_1 - 50| \le 50$, so $a_1 \le 100$.  Equality holds when $a_1 = 100$ and $a_i = 0$ for $i > 1$.  However, we are given that $1 + a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{100} = 100$, so $a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{100} = 99$. Let $S = \sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i = 99$. Then $\sum_{i=1}^{100} (a_i - 50)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{100} (a_i^2 - 100a_i + 2500) = \sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i^2 - 100S + 250000 = \sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i^2 - 9900 + 250000 = 250000 - 9900 + \sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i^2 = 240100 + \sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i^2$.  By Cauchy-Schwarz, $100(\sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i^2) \ge (\sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i)^2 = 99^2$, so $\sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i^2 \ge \frac{99^2}{100} \approx 98.01$. Thus $240100 + \sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i^2 \ge 240100$. Then $(a_1 - 50)^2 \le 2500$, so $a_1 \le 100$."

If four entries are 23, then $148 + 2e \ge 4(23) = 92$, which means $2e \ge -56$, so $e \ge -28$. Let the center be $e$. The sum of all entries after the transformation is $2(74) + 4e$. Since 4 entries are 23, we must have $2(74) + 4e \ge 4(23) = 92$, so $148 + 4e \ge 92$, which means $4e \ge -56$, so $e \ge -14$.  If the corners are 23, then $2(74) + 4e = 92$, which gives $e = 18$."

"Across all polynomials $P$ such that $P(n)$ is an integer for all integers $n$, determine, with proof, all possible values of $P(i)$, where $i^2 = -1$.","We claim the answer is every complex number $a + bi$ where $a$ and $b$ are rationals whose simplified denominators are not multiples of any prime congruent to 1 modulo 4. The proof consists of two main steps: proving that powers of $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ can’t appear in the denominator, and showing all possible values are attainable. We show three different methods of the former part. \textbf{Impossibility via elementary number theory} We first show that no other values are possible. Indeed, it is well known that any polynomial that $P$ maps $\mathbb{Z}$ into itself must be of the form $P(n) = \sum_{k=0}^m a_k \binom{n}{k}$ for integers $a_k$ and where we treat the binomials as formal polynomials. This may be proved via finite differences. It is therefore sufficient to show that for any $k$, $\binom{i}{k} = \frac{i(i-1)...(i-(k-1))}{k(k-1)...1}$ can be simplified to a fraction of the form $\frac{a+bi}{c}$, where $a, b, c$ are integers and $c$ is not divisible by any prime that is 1 modulo 4. Pick any prime $p$ that is 1 modulo 4. Since $p$ is 1 modulo 4, there exist distinct residue classes $x, y$ modulo $p$ so that $x^2 \\equiv y^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod p$. We will show that for every integer $r \\le k$ divisible by $p$ in the denominator, we can pair it with a disjoint set $\{rx, ry\}$ of two positive integers less than $k$ in these two residue classes so that $(i - rx)(i - ry)$ has real and complex parts divisible by the highest power of $p$ dividing $r$. Thus any factor of $p$ that is 1 modulo 4 in the denominator, exists in the numerator as well, which suffices. \textbf{Impossibility via Gaussian Integers} We work in the ring of Gaussian Integers $\mathbb{Z}[i] = \{a + bi : a, b \\in \mathbb{Z}\}$, which is sitting inside number field $\mathbb{Q}[i] = \{a + bi : a, b \\in \mathbb{Q}\}$. It’s well-known that $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a unique factorization domain. For any Gaussian prime $\pi$, let $\nu_\pi(z)$ denote the exponent of $\pi$ in the factorization of $z$. Let $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ be a prime. It’s well known that $p$ splits into two Gaussian primes, $p = \pi\overline{\pi}$. Note that it suffices to show $\nu_\pi(i(i - 1)(i - 2)...(i - k + 1)) \\ge \nu_\pi(k!) = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \left\lfloor \frac{k}{p^j} \right\rfloor$ because the similar statement for $\overline{\pi}$ will follow. The key claim is the following: \textbf{Claim.} For any integer $t \\ge 1$ and $n$, at least one of numbers $i - n - 1, i - n - 2, ..., i - n - p^t$ is divisible by $\pi^t$. Using the claim repeatedly, we find that among numbers $i, i - 1, i - 2, ..., i - k + 1$, at least $\left\lfloor \frac{k}{p} \right\rfloor$ are divisible by $\pi$, at least $\left\lfloor \frac{k}{p^2} \right\rfloor$ are divisible by $\pi^2$, at least $\left\lfloor \frac{k}{p^3} \right\rfloor$ are divisible by $\pi^3$, ... Using these altogether suffices to prove (*). \textbf{Impossibility via p-adics} Let $P(i) = a + bi$, and note that $P(-i) = a - bi$. Fix some $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, and consider the $p$-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_p$ lying in $\mathbb{Q}_p$. Note that $x^2 + 1 = 0$ has a solution in $\mathbb{Z}_p$, and hence $\\pm i \\in \mathbb{Z}_p$. Now take a sequence of integers $m_k$ converging to $i$ in $\mathbb{Z}_p$, so $-m_k$ converges to $-i$. Then since polynomials are continuous, $P(m_k)$ converges to $P(i)$ and $P(-m_k)$ converges to $P(-i)$, so $P(m_k) + P(-m_k)$ and $P(m_k) - P(-m_k)$ converge to $2x$ and $2yi$ respectively. Finally, since $P(m_k)$ and $P(-m_k)$ are integers, they have nonnegative $p$-adic valuation, and so by continuity, $2x$ and $2y$ have nonnegative $p$-adic valuation. Thus, when written as simplified fractions, $a$ and $b$ cannot have any powers of $p$ in their denominator, as desired. \textbf{Construction} We now show that all of the claimed values are possible. The set of polynomials, $P$, taking $\mathbb{Z}$ to itself is closed under addition and multiplication, and therefore so is the set of possible values of $P(i)$. It clearly contains $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ by taking linear polynomials. Thus it suffices to show that $p^{-1}$ is attainable for every prime $p$ that is not 1 modulo 4. $2^{-1}$ is achieved by taking $P(x) = \frac{1}{4}x(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)+3$, so we may focus our attention only on the case where $p$ is 3 modulo 4. It is then further sufficient to show that some $(a+bi)^{p-1}$ is attainable for $a, b \\in \mathbb{Z}$ not both divisible by $p$ because then $(a-bi) \cdot (a+bi)^{p-1} = (a^2+b^2)^{p-1}$ is also obtainable and cannot be an integer since -1 is not a quadratic residue modulo $p$, so Bézout’s Theorem shows that $p^{-1}$ is attainable. Now with this goal in mind, observe that $\binom{i}{p-1}$ has denominator divisible by $p$, but numerator not divisible by $p$ since again, $-1$ is not a quadratic residue modulo $p$. Hence we can find some integer $m$ so that $m \binom{i}{p-1} = (a+bi)^{p-1}$ where $a$ and $b$ aren’t both divisible by $p$ as desired."

The first vector has length $1$, so by Pythagorean’s theorem, the second vector has length $\sqrt{65 - 1} = 8$, so we have $\frac{1}{x^2} + \frac{1}{y^2} = 64 \implies \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \pm 8xy$. However, the first equation indicates that $x < 0$, while the second equation indicates that $y > 0$, so $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = -8xy$. Plugging this into both of the starting equations give $xy < 0$. Thus, $-\frac{1}{8y} - \frac{1}{x} = 7$ and $-\frac{1}{8x} + \frac{1}{y} = 4$. Solving this gives $(x, y) = \left(-\frac{13}{96}, \frac{13}{40}\right)$, which works."
Compute the sum of all positive integers $n$ such that $50 \le n \le 100$ and $2n + 3$ does not divide $2n! - 1$.,"We claim that if $n \ge 10$, then $2n + 3 \nmid 2n! - 1$ if and only if both $n + 1$ and $2n + 3$ are prime. If both $n + 1$ and $2n + 3$ are prime, then assume $2n + 3 | 2n! - 1$. By Fermat Little Theorem, $2n + 3 | 2^{2n+2} + 1$. However, since $n + 1$ is prime, $\gcd(2n + 2, n!) = 2$, so $2n + 3 | 2^2 - 1 = 3$, a contradiction. If $2n + 3$ is composite, then $\phi(2n + 3)$ is even and is at most $2n$, so $\phi(2n + 3) | n!$, done. If $n + 1$ is composite but $2n + 3$ is prime, then $2n + 2 | n!$, so $2n + 3 | 2n! - 1$. The prime numbers between 50 and 100 are 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97. If one of these is $n + 1$, then the only numbers that make $2n + 3$ prime are 53, 83, and 89, making $n$ one of 52, 82, and 88. These sum to 222."
Compute the number of ways to divide a 20 × 24 rectangle into 4 × 5 rectangles. (Rotations and reflections are considered distinct.),"For convenience, say the edge of length 20 is vertical. Consider some vertical line inside the rectangle. It must pass through rectangles of some heights adding to 20. In particular, these heights correspond to ways to add up to 20 with fours and fives, which is either 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 or 5 + 5 + 5 + 5. These options correspond to columns of rectangles with width 5 or 4, respectively. In particular, we need to span the width of the original 20 × 24 rectangle using these columns, meaning that we can just count the number of ways to add to 24 with fours and fives. 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 There are two ways to do this: either 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 or 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5.

"A lame king is a chess piece that can move from a cell to any cell that shares at least one vertex with it, except for the cells in the same column as the current cell. A lame king is placed in the top-left cell of a 7 × 7 grid. Compute the maximum number of cells it can visit without visiting the same cell twice (including its starting cell).","Color the columns all-black and all-white, alternating by column. Each move the lame king takes will switch the color it’s on. Assuming the king starts on a black cell, there are 28 black and 21 white cells, so it can visit at most 22 + 21 = 43 cells in total, which is easily achievable:"
Compute the number of ways there are to assemble 2 red unit cubes and 25 white unit cubes into a 3 × 3 × 3 cube such that red is visible on exactly 4 faces of the larger cube. (Rotations and reflections are considered distinct.),"We do casework on the two red unit cubes; they can either be in a corner, an edge, or the center of the face. • If they are both in a corner, they must be adjacent – for each configuration, this corresponds to an edge, of which there are 12. • If one is in the corner and the other is at an edge, we have 8 choices to place the corner. For the edge, the red edge square has to go on the boundary of the faces touching the red corner square, and there are six places here. Thus, we get 8 · 6 = 48 configurations. • If one is a corner and the other is in the center of a face, we again have 8 choices for the corner and 3 choices for the center face (the faces not touching the red corner). This gives 8·3 = 8+8+8 = 24 options. • We have now completed the cases with a red corner square! Now suppose we have two edges: If we chose in order, we have 12 choices for the first cube. For the second cube, we must place the edge so it covers two new faces, and thus we have five choices. Since we could have picked these edges in either order, we divide by two to avoid overcounting, and we have 12 · 5/2 = 30 in this case. Now, since edges and faces only cover at most 2 and 1 face respectively, no other configuration works. Thus we have all the cases, and we add: 12 + 48 + 24 + 30 = 114 ."
"Sally the snail sits on the 3 × 24 lattice of points (i, j) for all 1 ≤ i ≤ 3 and 1 ≤ j ≤ 24. She wants to visit every point in the lattice exactly once. In a move, Sally can move to a point in the lattice exactly one unit away. Given that Sally starts at (2, 1), compute the number of possible paths Sally can take.","On her first turn, Sally cannot continue moving down the middle row. She must turn either to the bottom row or the top row. WLOG, she turns to the top row, and enters the cell (3, 1) and we will multiply by 2 later. Then, we can see that the path must finish in (1, 1). So, we will follow these two branches of the path, one for the start and one for the end. These branches must both move one unit up, and then one of the paths must move into the center row. Both branches move up one unit, and then the path in the middle row must go back to fill the corner. After this, we have exactly the same scenario as before, albeit with two fewer rows. So, for each additional two rows, we have a factor of two and thus there are 2$^{12}$ = 4096 paths."
"The country of HMMTLand has 8 cities. Its government decides to construct several two-way roads between pairs of distinct cities.

Compute the number of ways HMMTLand could have constructed the roads.","Let the cities be numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. WLOG, 1 is connected to 2, 3, and 4. First suppose 2 and 3 are connected; then 3 and 1 share a second common neighbor, which must be 4 (as 1 is not connected to anything else). Likewise 2 and 4 are connected, and so 5, 6, 7, 8 are pairwise connected as well, so the graph consists of two disjoint copies of K4: 1 4 2 3 5 8 6 7 There are $\binom{8}{4}/2 = 35$ ways to partition the 8 vertices into two groups of 4, so there are 35 such graphs. Otherwise, none of 2, 3, 4 are connected to each other. Then 2 and 3 must share a common neighbor, as must 3 and 4, and 2 and 4.

The last vertex must then be connected to these three, creating a cube graph. 4 8 1 2 5 6 3 7 A cube has 48 symmetries, so the number of such graphs is $8!/48 = 840$. The total is 35 + 840 = 875 ."
"In each cell of a 4 × 4 grid, one of the two diagonals is drawn uniformly at random. Compute the probability that the resulting 32 triangular regions can be colored red and blue so that any two regions sharing an edge have different colors.","Give each cell coordinates from (1, 1) to (4, 4). Claim. The grid has a desired coloring if and only if every vertex not on the boundary meets an even number of edges and diagonals. Proof. If this were not the case, the odd number of regions around the vertex would have to alternate between the two colors, which is clearly impossible. In the event that every vertex has an even number of incident edges, it is not hard to show that the grid is always colorable. We claim the diagonals drawn in the cells of form (1, a) and (a, 1) for 1 ≤ a ≤ 4 uniquely determine the rest (for a valid coloring to exist). Indeed, given the diagonals for any three cells around a vertex, we can uniquely determine the fourth one using the parity in the claim above. If (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1) are fixed, so is (2, 2); likewise so are (2, 3) and (2, 4), etc. until the whole grid is fixed. The solid lines force the dotted lines as described above. Thus, once the seven cells along the top row and leftmost column are determined, the remaining nine have a $1/2^9 = 1/512$ chance of being selected in a way that admits a coloring."
"There is a grid of height 2 stretching infinitely in one direction. Between any two edge-adjacent cells of the grid, there is a door that is locked with probability 1/2 independent of all other doors. Philip starts in a corner of the grid (in the starred cell). Compute the expected number of cells that Philip can reach, assuming he can only travel between cells if the door between them is unlocked.","For clarity, we will number our grid, with (0,0) being the corner that Philip starts in, and the grid stretching in the positive x direction, i.e. all elements of the grid are of the form (x, y), with y ∈ {0, 1} and x ∈ N. We will use recursion and casework. Let A be the expected number of reachable cells given that the door between (0, 0) and (0, 1) is unlocked, and B be the expected number of cells given that door is closed. Since that door is locked 1/2 of the time, our answer is (A+B)/2. We can write recurrence relations by considering the different configurations of the doors in the first 4 cells. For the sake of writing, let W be the (0, 0) − (0, 1) door, X be the (0, 0) − (1, 0) door, Y be the (0, 1) − (1, 1) door, and Z be the (1, 0) − (1, 1) door. Let’s start with the case where W is unlocked and compute A:  Solving the system of these two linear equations, we get A = 40/7, B = 24/7 and (A+B)/2 = 32/7."
"Rishabh has 2024 pairs of socks in a drawer. He draws socks from the drawer uniformly at random, without replacement, until he has drawn a pair of identical socks. Compute the expected number of unpaired socks he has drawn when he stops.","We solve for the expected number of total socks drawn and subtract two at the end. Let $E_n$ be the expected number of socks drawn for n pairs of socks, so that $E_1 = 2$. Suppose there are n pairs of socks, Rishabh continued to draw socks until the drawer was empty, and without loss of generality let the last sock drawn be red. If we ignore the two red socks, the process is equivalent to drawing from a drawer with n − 1 pairs of socks. Let k be the number of socks drawn until a pair of identical socks is found, after ignoring the two red socks. Then the first red sock has probability of being before this stopping point, so the expected value is $k + \frac{k}{2n-1}$. Since the expected value of k is $E_{n-1}$, we have $\frac{k}{2n-1} = k \cdot \frac{1}{2n-1} \cdot E_{n-1}$. Applying this recurrence, we get $E_n = \frac{2n}{2n-1} \cdot E_{n-1}$. Subtracting two and plugging in n = 2024 gives a final answer of $4\binom{2024}{2024} -2$."
"Compute the number of triples $(f, g, h)$ of permutations on $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ such that $f(g(h(x))) = h(g(f(x))) = g(x)$, $g(h(f(x))) = f(h(g(x))) = h(x)$, and $h(f(g(x))) = g(f(h(x))) = f(x)$ for all $x \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$","Let $fg$ represent the composition of permutations $f$ and $g$, where $(fg)(x) = f(g(x))$ for all $x \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$. Evaluating $fghfh$ in two ways, we get $f = gfh = (fgh)fh = fghfh = f(ghf)h = fhh$, so $hh = 1$. Similarly, we get $f$, $g$, and $h$ are all involutions. Then $fgh = g \implies fg = gh$, so $fg = gh = hf$. Let $x := fg = gh = hf$. Then $x^3 = (fg)(gh)(hf) = 1$. We can also show that $fg = gh = hf$ along with $f, g, h$ being involutions is enough to recover the initial conditions, so we focus on satisfying these new conditions. If $x = 1$, then $f = g = h$ is an involution. There are $1 + \binom{5}{2} + \binom{5}{2,2,1} = 26$ involutions, so this case gives 26 solutions. Suppose $x \neq 1$. Then since $x^3 = 1$, $x$ is composed of a 3-cycle and two fixed points, of which there are 20 choices. WLOG $x = (1 2 3)$. It can be checked that $\{1, 2, 3\}$ must map to itself for all of $f, g, h$ and also $\{4, 5\}$. We can either have all of $f, g, h$ map 4 and 5 to themselves or each other. Restricted to $\{1, 2, 3\}$, they are some rotation of $(1 2)$, $(2 3)$, $(1 3)$. Each of the 20 cases thus gives $2 \cdot 3 = 6$ triples, so overall we get $20 \cdot 6 = 120$.

A peacock is a ten-digit positive integer that uses each digit exactly once. Compute the number of peacocks that are exactly twice another peacock.,"We begin with the following observation: Claim 1. Let x be a peacock. Then, 2x is a peacock if and only if: • the multiplication x · 2 uses five carries, • each of the pairs of digits (0, 5), (1, 6), (2, 7), (3, 8), (4, 9) receives exactly one carry. • The leading digit is not 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Proof. After the multiplication of x · 2, we will have a ten digit number. Let’s first consider the output without carrying. It consists of the digits 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 twice each, occupying positions where pairs of digits (0, 5), (1, 6), (2, 7), (3, 8), (4, 9) were in x. However, we guaranteed that one digit from each pair received a carry, meaning all ten digits are present after adding in the carries. We will now biject all peacocks to the following combination of objects: • a queue of low digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, in any order with the constraint that 0 is not first, • a queue of high digits 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, in any order, and • of each of the pairs of digits (0, 5), (1, 6), (2, 7), (3, 8), (4, 9) mark one of them to receive a carry, except we are not allowed to mark the final digit in the high queue. We construct a correspondence from these objects to peacocks by accumulating digits to an initially empty string. We’ll say that we poll a queue by popping its front entry and appending it to the end of this string. First, poll the low queue. Then, if we have just polled a marked digit, poll the high queue; otherwise, poll the low queue. We repeat this until all queues are emptied. Using this bijection, we just need to find the number of initial settings of the queues and marked digits. There are 4 · 4! ways to order the low number queue. There are then 5! ways to order the high number queue. Finally, of each of the four pairs of digits not inluding the final high digit, there are $2^4$ ways to mark them. This gives an answer of 4 · 4! · 5! · 2$^4$ = 184320 ."
Compute the sum of all integers $n$ such that $n^2 - 3000$ is a perfect square.,"If $n^2 - 3000$ is a square, then $(-n)^2 - 3000$ is also a square, so the sum is $\boxed{0}$."
"Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be real numbers such that $a + b + c = 100$, $ab + bc + ca = 20$, and $(a + b)(a + c) = 24$.

From this, we subtract the second equation to obtain $a^2 = 4$, so $a = \pm 2$. If $a = 2$, plugging into the first equation gives us $b + c = 98$ and plugging into the second equation gives us $2(b + c) + bc = 20 \implies 2(98) + bc = 20 \implies bc = -176$. Then, if $a = -2$, plugging into the first equation gives us $b + c = 102$, and plugging into the second equation gives us $-2(b + c) + bc = 20 \implies -2(102) + bc = 20 \implies bc = 224$. Therefore, the possible values of $bc$ are $\boxed{224, -176}$."
Compute the sum of all positive integers $n$ such that $n^2 - 3000$ is a perfect square.,"Suppose $n^2 - 3000 = x^2$, so $n^2 - x^2 = 3000$. This factors as $(n - x)(n + x) = 3000$. Thus, we have $n - x = 2a$ and $n + x = 2b$ for some positive integers $a, b$ such that $ab = 750$ and $a < b$. Therefore, we have $n = a + b$, so the sum will be just sum of divisors of $750 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5^3$, which is $(1 + 2)(1 + 3)(1 + 5 + 25 + 125) = \boxed{1872}$."
Let $a \star b = ab - 2$.

Then the ”new operation” is $a \dagger b \equiv -(a + b) + 7 \pmod{10}$, where $a$ and $b$ track the tens digits. Now $(a \dagger b) \dagger c \equiv -(a + b) + 7 \dagger c \equiv a + b - c \pmod{10}$. Thus, our expression has tens digit congruent to $-0 + 1 - 2 + 3 - \dots - 54 + 55 - 56 - 57 + 7 \equiv -28 - 57 + 7 \equiv 2 \pmod{10}$, making the answer $\boxed{29}$."
A circle is tangent to both branches of the hyperbola $x^2 - 20y^2 = 24$ as well as the $x$-axis. Compute the area of this circle.,"Let $a$ be the $y$-coordinate of both tangency points to the hyperbola. Then, the equation of the circle must be in the form $x^2 + c(y - a)^2 = 24 + 20y^2$. Comparing the $y^2$-coefficient, we see that $c = 21$. Moreover, we need it to pass through $(0, 0)$, so $21a^2 = 24$. Thus, the equation of the circle is $x^2 + y^2 - 42ay + 21a^2 = 24 \implies x^2 + (y - 21a)^2 = (21a)^2$, so the radius is $21a$, and the area is $(441a^2)\pi = 504\pi$."
"Point P is inside a square ABCD such that $\angle APB = 135^\circ$, $PC = 12$, and $PD = 15$. Compute the area of this square.","Let $x = AP$ and $y = BP$.

Therefore, by Pythagorean’s theorem, $PC^2 = x^2 + 2y^2$. Similarly, $PD^2 = y^2 + 2x^2$. Thus, $x^2 = 102$ and $y^2 = 21$, so $xy = 3\sqrt{238}$. By the Law of Cosines, the area of the square is $AB^2 = AP^2 + BP^2 - 2\cos(135^\circ)(AP)(BP) = x^2 + y^2 + \sqrt{2}xy = 123 + 6\sqrt{119}$."

However, since $\triangle BFA \cong \triangle ABC$, we have $\frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{BF}{BA} = \frac{BA}{BC} \implies AB^2 = BC \cdot BF$. Since $DE \parallel BC$, $\angle ADE = \angle ABC = \alpha$. In $\triangle ADE$, $AD=x$, $AE=x$, $DE=y$. In $\triangle ABC$, $AB=2x$, $AC=2x$, $BC=2y$. Then $\frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{2x}{2y} = \frac{x}{y}$. In similar triangles, $\frac{x}{y} = \frac{2x}{2y} = \sqrt{2}$."
Find the number of positive integer divisors of 12! that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.,"We have $12! = 2^{10} \cdot 3^5 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7 \cdot 11$. A divisor is of the form $2^a 3^b 5^c 7^d 11^e$ where $0 \le a \le 10$, $0 \le b \le 5$, $0 \le c \le 2$, $0 \le d \le 1$, $0 \le e \le 1$. We want this to be $1 \pmod 3$. Since $2 \equiv -1 \pmod 3$, $5 \equiv -1 \pmod 3$, $7 \equiv 1 \pmod 3$, $11 \equiv -1 \pmod 3$, we need $a+c+e$ to be even and $b$ can be anything. The number of choices for $a, c, e$ such that $a+c+e$ is even is $\frac{11 \times 3 \times 2}{2} = 33$. The number of choices for $b$ is 6. So there are $33 \times 6 = 198$ such divisors. However, we must have $a+c+e$ to be even, so there are $(11)(3)(2) = 66$ choices."
"Find the largest real number $\lambda$ such that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 \ge ab + \lambda bc + cd$ for all real numbers a, b, c, d.","Let $f(a, b, c, d) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 - ab - \lambda bc - cd$. Completing the square, we have $a^2 - ab + \frac{b^2}{4} + \frac{3b^2}{4} - \lambda bc + c^2 + d^2 - cd + \frac{c^2}{4} + \frac{3c^2}{4} = (a - \frac{b}{2})^2 + (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}b - \frac{2\lambda}{2\sqrt{3}}c)^2 + (d - \frac{c}{2})^2 + \frac{3}{4}b^2 + \frac{3}{4}c^2 - \frac{3\lambda^2}{12}c^2 \ge 0$. Thus we need $\frac{3}{4} - \frac{\lambda^2}{4} \ge 0$, so $\lambda \le 2$. Then we need $3b^2 - 4\lambda bc + 3c^2 \ge 0$, which requires $16\lambda^2 \le 36$, so $\lambda \le \frac{3}{2}$."
"How many of the first 1000 positive integers can be written as the sum of finitely many distinct numbers from the sequence 30, 31, 32, ...?","Let $N$ be a positive integer.

We eliminate those in the form $1+2+\cdots+k$, $p^k$, and $p+1$. The integers of the form $1+2+\cdots+k$ are the triangular numbers: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21.  The integers which are prime powers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19.  The integers of the form $p+1$ are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, .... Removing these from $\{1, 2, \dots, 22\}$ leaves 22. Since $22 = 2 \cdot 11$ is not a prime power, $22 - 1 = 21$ is not prime, and $1 + 2 + \cdots + 6 = 21 < 22 < 28 = 1 + 2 + \cdots + 7$, 22 is the smallest number not in the three forms, as desired. Thus, the smallest such integer is $\boxed{22}$. "
Let $f(x) = x^2 + 6x + 7$. Determine the smallest possible value of $f(f(f(f(x))))$ over all real numbers $x$.,"We have $f(x) = x^2 + 6x + 7 = (x+3)^2 - 2$.  Thus $f(x) \ge -2$ for all real $x$. Then $f(f(x)) \ge f(-2) = (-2)^2 + 6(-2) + 7 = 4 - 12 + 7 = -1$.  Next, $f(f(f(x))) \ge f(-1) = (-1)^2 + 6(-1) + 7 = 2$. Finally, $f(f(f(f(x)))) \ge f(2) = 2^2 + 6(2) + 7 = 23$. Equality holds when $x = -3$. Therefore, the minimum value is $\boxed{23}$."
"The side lengths of a triangle are distinct positive integers. One of the side lengths is a multiple of 42, and another is a multiple of 72. What is the minimum possible length of the third side?","Suppose the side lengths are $42a$ and $72b$ for positive integers $a$ and $b$. Let $c$ be the third side. Then by the triangle inequality, $c < 42a + 72b$, $42a < c + 72b$, and $72b < c + 42a$. Subtracting, we have $c > |42a - 72b|$. Since $42a$ and $72b$ are both divisible by 6, $42a - 72b$ is divisible by 6. Thus $c > |42a - 72b| \ge 6$, so $c \ge 7$.  When $a = 7$ and $b = 4$, we have sides 294, 288, 7, which form a triangle since $294 < 288 + 7$, $288 < 294 + 7$, and $7 < 294 + 288$. The minimum length of the third side is $\boxed{7}$."

"Let H be a regular hexagon with side length one. Peter picks a point P uniformly and at random within H, then draws the largest circle with center P that is contained in H. What is the probability that the radius of this circle is less than $\frac{1}{2}$?","We first cut the regular hexagon H by segments connecting its center to each vertex into six different equilateral triangles with side lengths 1. Therefore, each point inside H is contained in some equilateral triangle. We first see that for each point inside an equilateral triangle, the radius of the largest circle with center P which is contained in H equals the shortest distance from P to the nearest side of the hexagon, which is also a side of the triangle in which it is contained. Consider that the height of each triangle is $\sqrt{3}$. The region inside the triangle containing all points with distance more than $\frac{1}{2}$ to the side of the hexagon is an equilateral triangle with a height of $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Consequently, the area inside the triangle containing all points with distance less than $\frac{1}{2}$ to the side of the hexagon has area $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}$. This is $\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}$ of the area of the triangle, which is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}$. Since all triangles are identical and the point P is picked uniformly within H, the probability that the radius of the largest circle with center P which is contained in H is less than $\frac{1}{2}$ is $\frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}}{ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} } = \frac{3}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, as desired."
"Let ABCDEF be a convex hexagon with the following properties: (a) AC and AE trisect $\angle BAF$. (b) BE $\parallel$ CD and CF $\parallel$ DE. (c) AB = 2AC = 4AE = 8AF. Suppose that quadrilaterals ACDE and ADEF have area 2014 and 1400, respectively. Find the area of quadrilateral ABCD.","From conditions (a) and (c), we know that triangles AFE, AEC and ACB are similar to one another, each being twice as large as the preceding one in each dimension. Let AE $\cap$ FC = P and AC $\cap$ EB = Q. Then, since the quadrilaterals AFEC and AECB are similar to one another, we have AP : PE = AQ : QC. Therefore, PQ $\parallel$ EC. Let PC $\cap$ QE = T. We know by condition (b) that BE $\parallel$ CD and CF $\parallel$ DE. Therefore, triangles PQT and ECD have their three sides parallel to one another, and so must be similar. From this we deduce that the three lines joining the corresponding vertices of the two triangles must meet at a point, i.e., that PE, TD, QC are concurrent. Since PE and QC intersect at A, the points A, T, D are collinear. Now, because TCDE is a parallelogram, TD bisects EC. Therefore, since A, T, D are collinear, AD also bisects EC. So the triangles ADE and ACD have equal area. Now, since the area of quadrilateral ACDE is 2014, the area of triangle ADE is 2014/2 = 1007. And since the area of quadrilateral ADEF is 1400, the area of triangle AFE is 1400 - 1007 = 393. Therefore, the area of quadrilateral ABCD is $16 \cdot 393 + 1007 = 7295$, as desired."

Since XM $\parallel$ AC and XN $\parallel$ BC, we produce equal angles. So, by similar triangles, $\frac{XM}{AC} = \frac{XN}{BC}$, we have $XM = XN = k$. Moreover, triangles MCX and NCX are congruent isosceles triangles with vertices M and N, respectively. Since CX is an angle bisector, then CX and MN are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

How many ways can you remove one tile from a $2014 \times 2014$ grid such that the resulting figure can be tiled by $1 \times 3$ and $3 \times 1$ rectangles?,"Number the rows and columns of the grid from 0 to 2013, thereby assigning an ordered pair to each tile. We claim that a tile $(i, j)$ may be selected if and only if $i \equiv j \equiv 0 \pmod 3$; call such a square good. First, let us show that this condition is sufficient. Observe that any such square $s$ is the corner of a $3 \times 3$ square $S$ whose vertices are all good. Then the sides of $S$ partition the board into nine canonical regions. It’s easy to see that all of them can be suitably tiled. Now we show that only good squares can be removed. Let $\omega$ be a non-real cube root of unity. In the tile with coordinates $(i, j)$, place the complex number $\omega^{i+j}$. Note that any $1 \times 1$ rectangle placed on the grid must cover three squares with sum $1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0$. Now, note that the sum of the numbers on the whole $2014 \times 2014$ grid, including the removed tile, is $\sum_{k=0}^{2013} \sum_{l=0}^{2013} \omega^{k+l} = 2013^2$. Therefore, it is necessary that $i + j \equiv 0 \pmod 3$. Hence the answer is exactly the set of good squares, of which there are $\frac{2014^2}{9} = 451584$."
"Let M denote the number of positive integers which divide 2014!, and let N be the integer closest to $\ln(M)$.

Using the Prime Number Theorem or otherwise, one might estimate about 150 primes less than 1007 and 100 primes between 1008 and 2014. Each prime between 1008 and 2014 contributes exactly $\ln 2$. For the other 150 primes we estimate $\ln \frac{2014}{p}$ as their contribution, which gives $150 \ln \frac{2014}{1000/e} \approx 150 \times 3.5 = 525$.

Bassanio wishes to end with coins that are all the same color, and he wishes to do this while having as many coins as possible. How many coins will he end up with, and what color will they be?","7 yellow coins. Let $r, y, b$ denote the numbers of red, yellow, and blue coins respectively. Note that each of the three possible exchanges do not change the parities of $y - r, b - y$, or $b - r$, and eventually one of these differences becomes zero. Since $b - r$ is the only one of these differences that is originally even, it must be the one that becomes zero, and so Bassanio will end with some number of yellow coins. Furthermore, Bassanio loses a coin in each exchange, and he requires at least five exchanges to rid himself of the blue coins, so he will have at most $12 - 5 = 7$ yellow coins at the end of his trading. It remains to construct a sequence of trades that result in seven yellow coins. First, Bassanio will exchange one yellow and one blue coin for one red coin, leaving him with four red coins, three yellow coins, and four blue coins. He then converts the red and blue coins into yellow coins, resulting in 7 yellow coins, as desired."
"Let $\lfloor x \rfloor$ denote the largest integer less than or equal to $x$, and let $\{x\}$ denote the fractional part of $x$. For example, $\lfloor \pi \rfloor = 3$, and $\{\pi\} = 0.14159...$, while $\lfloor 100 \rfloor = 100$ and $\{100\} = 0$. If $n$ is the largest solution to the equation $\frac{\lfloor n \rfloor}{n} = \frac{2015}{2016}$, compute $\{n\}$.","$\frac{2014}{2015}$. Note that $n = \lfloor n \rfloor + \{n\}$, so $\frac{\lfloor n \rfloor}{\lfloor n \rfloor + \{n\}} = \frac{2015}{2016} \implies 2016 \lfloor n \rfloor = 2015 \lfloor n \rfloor + 2015 \{n\} \implies \lfloor n \rfloor = 2015 \{n\}$. Hence, $n = \lfloor n \rfloor + \{n\} = 2016 \{n\}$, and so $n$ is maximized when $\lfloor n \rfloor$ is also maximized. As $\lfloor n \rfloor$ is an integer, and $\{n\} < 1$, the maximum possible value of $\lfloor n \rfloor$ is 2014. Therefore, $\{n\} = \frac{\lfloor n \rfloor}{2015} = \frac{2014}{2015}$."
"Call a set of positive integers good if there is a partition of it into two sets $S$ and $T$, such that there do not exist three elements $a, b, c \in S$ such that $ab = c$ and such that there do not exist three elements $a, b, c \in T$ such that $ab = c$ ($a$ and $b$ need not be distinct). Find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that the set $\{2, 3, 4, ..., n\}$ is not good.","65536. First, we claim that the set $\{2, 4, 8, 256, 65536\}$ is not good. Assume the contrary and say $2 \in S$. Then since $2^2 = 4$, we have $4 \in T$. And since $4^2 = 16$, we have $16 \in S$. Then since $16^2 = 256$, we have $256 \in T$. Then since $256^2 = 65536$, we have $65536 \in S$. Now, note that we cannot place 8 in either S or T, contradiction. Hence $n \le 65536$. And the partition $S = \{2, 3\} \cup \{256, 257, ..., 65535\}$ and $T = \{4, 5, ..., 255\}$ shows that $n \ge 65536$. Therefore $n = 65536$."
"Kelvin the Frog is trying to hop across a river. The river has 10 lilypads on it, and he must hop on them in a specific order (the order is unknown to Kelvin).

Assuming Kelvin is infinitely intelligent, what is the minimum number of hops he will need to guarantee reaching the other side?","176. Kelvin needs (at most) $i(10-i)$ hops to determine the $i$th lilypad he should jump to, then an additional 11 hops to actually get across the river. Thus he requires $\sum_{i=1}^{10} i(10 - i) + 11 = 176$ hops to guarantee success."
Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral whose diagonals AC and BD meet at P. Let the area of triangle APB be 24 and let the area of triangle CPD be 25. What is the minimum possible area of quadrilateral ABCD?,Note that $\angle APB = 180^\circ - \angle BPC = \angle CPD = 180^\circ - \angle DPA$ so $4[BPC][DPA] = (PB \cdot PC \cdot \sin BPC)(PD \cdot PA \cdot \sin DPA) = (PA \cdot PB \cdot \sin APB)(PC \cdot PD \cdot \sin CPD) = 4[APB][CPD] = 2400 \implies [BPC][DPA] = 600$. Hence by AM-GM we have that $[BPC] + [DPA] \ge 2\sqrt{[BPC][DPA]} = 20\sqrt{6}$ so the minimum area of quadrilateral ABCD is $49 + 20\sqrt{6}$.
"Find any quadruple of positive integers $(a, b, c, d)$ satisfying $a^3 + b^4 + c^5 = d^{11}$ and $abc < 105$.","$(a, b, c, d) = (128, 32, 16, 4)$ or $(a, b, c, d) = (160, 16, 8, 4)$. It’s easy to guess that there are solutions such that $a, b, c, d$ are in the form of $nx$, where $n$ is a rather small number. After a few attempts, we can see that we obtain simple equations when $n = 2$ or $n = 3$: for $n = 2$, the equation becomes in the form of $2^t + 2^t + 2^{t+1} = 2^{t+2}$ for some non-negative integer $t$; for $n = 3$, the equation becomes in the form of $3^t + 3^t + 3^t = 3^{t+1}$ for some non-negative integer $t$. In the first case, we hope that $t$ is a multiple of two of 3, 4, 5, that $t + 1$ is a multiple of the last one, and that $t + 2$ is a multiple of 11. Therefore, $t \equiv 15, 20, 24 \pmod{60}$ and $t \equiv 9 \pmod{11}$. It’s easy to check that the only solution that satisfies the given inequality is the solution with $t = 20$, and $(a, b, c, d) = (128, 32, 16, 4)$. In the case where $n = 3$, we must have that $t$ is a multiple of 60, which obviously doesn’t satisfy the inequality restriction. Remark: By programming, we find that the only two solutions are $(a, b, c, d) = (128, 32, 16, 4)$ and $(a, b, c, d) = (160, 16, 8, 4)$, with the the former being the intended solution."
"Find the number of triples $(a, b, c)$ of positive integers such that $a + ab + abc = 11$.","We can write $a + ab + abc = a(1 + b + bc)$. Since 11 is prime, $a = 11$ or $a = 1$. But since $b, c$ are both positive integers, we cannot have $a = 11$, and so $a = 1$. Then $1 + b + bc = 11 \implies b + bc = 10 \implies b(c + 1) = 10$, and since $c$ is a positive integer, only $b = 1, 2, 5$ are possible. This gives the 3 triples $(a, b, c) = (1, 1, 9), (1, 2, 4), (1, 5, 1)$. Therefore, there are $\boxed{3}$ such triples."
"Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers randomly (and independently) chosen from the range $[0, 1]$. Find the probability that $a, b$ and 1 form the side lengths of an obtuse triangle.","We require $a + b > 1$ and $a^2 + b^2 < 1$. Geometrically, this is the area enclosed in the quarter-circle centered at the origin with radius 1, not including the area enclosed by $a + b < 1$ (an isosceles right triangle with side length 1). The area of the quarter-circle is $\frac{\pi}{4}$, and the area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}$.  Therefore, our desired probability is $\frac{\frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{\pi - 2}{4}$.  The probability is $\boxed{\frac{\pi - 2}{4}}$."
"Neo has an infinite supply of red pills and blue pills. When he takes a red pill, his weight will double, and when he takes a blue pill, he will lose one pound. If Neo originally weighs one pound, what is the minimum number of pills he must take to make his weight 2015 pounds?","Suppose instead Neo started at a weight of 2015 pounds, instead had green pills, which halve his weight, and purple pills, which increase his weight by a pound, and he wished to reduce his weight to one pound.  It is clear that, if Neo were able to find such a sequence of pills in the case where he goes from 2015 pounds to 1 pound, he can perform the sequence in reverse (replacing green pills with red pills and purple pills with blue pills) to achieve the desired weight, so this problem is equivalent to the original. The optimal sequence is to take a purple pill when his weight is odd, and a green pill when his weight is even. His weight thus becomes $2015 \to 2016 \to 1008 \to 504 \to 252 \to 126 \to 63 \to 64 \to 32 \to 16 \to 8 \to 4 \to 2 \to 1$ which requires a total of 13 pills. Reversing this sequence solves the original problem directly. The minimum number of pills is $\boxed{13}$."

Consider all functions $f : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$ satisfying $f(f(x) + 2x + 20) = 15$. Call an integer $n$ good if $f(n)$ can take any integer value. Find the sum of all good integers $x$.,"For almost all integers $x$, $f(x) \neq -x - 20$. If $f(x) = -x - 20$, then $f(-x - 20 + 2x + 20) = 15 \implies -x - 20 = 15 \implies x = -35$. Now it suffices to prove that $f(-35)$ can take any value. $f(-35) = 15$ in the function $f(x) \equiv 15$. Otherwise, set $f(-35) = c$, and $f(x) = 15$ for all other $x$. It is easy to check that these functions all work. The sum of all good integers is $\boxed{-35}$."

As a result, $CM + MN + NC = CM + MI + NI + NC = CM + MA + NB + NC = AC + BC = 48$. Furthermore, $AC^2 + BC^2 = 36^2$. As a result, we have $AC^2 + 2AC \cdot BC + BC^2 = 48^2$, so $2AC \cdot BC = 48^2 - 36^2 = 12 \cdot 84$, and so $AC \cdot BC = 252$. The area of $\triangle ABC$ is $\boxed{252}$."
"Let ABCD be a quadrilateral with an inscribed circle $\omega$ that has center I. If IA = 5, IB = 7, IC = 4, ID = 9, find the value of $\frac{AB}{CD}$.","The I-altitudes of triangles AIB and CID are both equal to the radius of $\omega$, hence have equal length. Therefore $[AIB] = \frac{1}{2} AB \cdot r$ and $[CID] = \frac{1}{2} CD \cdot r$, so $\frac{[AIB]}{[CID]} = \frac{AB}{CD}$. Also note that $[AIB] = IA \cdot IB \cdot \sin(\angle AIB)$ and $[CID] = IC \cdot ID \cdot \sin(\angle CID)$, but since lines IA, IB, IC, ID bisect angles $\angle DAB, \angle ABC, \angle BCD, \angle CDA$ respectively we have that $\angle AIB + \angle CID = 180^\circ$. So, $\sin(\angle AIB) = \sin(\angle CID)$. Therefore $\frac{[AIB]}{[CID]} = \frac{IA \cdot IB}{IC \cdot ID}$. Hence $\frac{AB}{CD} = \frac{IA \cdot IB}{IC \cdot ID} = \frac{5 \cdot 7}{4 \cdot 9} = \frac{35}{36}$. The value is $\boxed{\frac{35}{36}}$."

The three sides of a right triangle form a geometric sequence. Determine the ratio of the length of the hypotenuse to the length of the shorter leg.,"Let the shorter leg have length $\ell$, and the common ratio of the geometric sequence be $r > 1$. Then the length of the other leg is $\ell r$, and the length of the hypotenuse is $\ell r^2$. Hence, $\ell^2 + (\ell r)^2 = (\ell r^2)^2 \implies \ell^2(r^2 + 1) = \ell^2 r^4 \implies r^2 + 1 = r^4$. Hence, $r^4 - r^2 - 1 = 0$, and therefore $r^2 = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}$. As $r > 1$, we have $r^2 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$, completing the problem as the ratio of the hypotenuse to the shorter side is $\frac{\ell r^2}{\ell} = r^2 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$."

"James writes down three integers. Alex picks some two of those integers, takes the average of them, and adds the result to the third integer. If the possible final results Alex could get are 42, 13, and 37, what are the three integers James originally chose?","Let $x, y, z$ be the integers. We have $\frac{x + y}{2} + z = 42$, $\frac{y + z}{2} + x = 13$, $\frac{x + z}{2} + y = 37$. Adding these three equations yields $2(x + y + z) = 92$, so $x + y + z = 46$. Then $x + y = 84 - 2z$, $y + z = 26 - 2x$, $x + z = 74 - 2y$. Subtracting $x + y + z = 46$ from each gives $x = 38 - 3z$, $y = 26 - 3x$, $z = 28 - 3y$.

We claim this is the smallest such integer. Note that $N < 2^{66}$. If $n$ has 3 distinct prime factors, it must be of the form $p^{30}q^{12}r^4$ for some primes $p, q, r$, so $n \ge 2^{30} \cdot 3^{12} \cdot 5^4$. If $n$ has 2 distinct prime factors, it must be of the form $p^eq^f$ where $(e + 1)(f + 1) = 2015$. It is easy to see that this means $e + f > 66$ so $n > 2^{66} > N$. If $n$ has only 1 prime factor, we have $n \ge 2^{2014} > N$. So $N$ is the smallest such integer, and the sum of its prime factors is $2 \cdot 30 + 3 \cdot 12 + 5 \cdot 4 = 116$."

What is the smallest possible perimeter of a triangle whose side lengths are all squares of distinct positive integers?,"There exist a triangle with side lengths $4^2, 5^2, 6^2$, which has perimeter 77.

Allen and Brian are playing a game in which they roll a 6-sided die until one of them wins. Allen wins if two consecutive rolls are equal and at most 3. Brian wins if two consecutive rolls add up to 7 and the latter is at most 3. What is the probability that Allen wins?,"Note that at any point in the game after the first roll, the probability that Allen wins depends only on the most recent roll, and not on any rolls before that one. So we may define $p$ as the probability that Allen wins at any point in the game, given that the last roll was a 1, 2, or 3, and $q$ as the probability that he wins given that the last roll was a 4, 5, or 6. Suppose at some point, the last roll was $r_1 \in \{1, 2, 3\}$, and the next roll is $r_2 \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$. By the definition of $p$, Allen wins with probability $p$. Furthermore, if $r_2 = r_1$, which happens with probability $\frac{1}{6}$, Allen wins. If $r_2 \in \{1, 2, 3\}$ but $r_2 \ne r_1$, which happens with probability $\frac{2}{6}$, neither Allen nor Brian wins, so they continue playing the game, now where the last roll was $r_2$. In this case, Allen wins with probability $p$. If $r_2 \in \{4, 5, 6\}$, which happens with probability $\frac{3}{6}$, neither Allen nor Brian wins, so they continue playing, now where the last roll was $r_2$. In this case, Allen wins with probability $q$. Hence, the probability that Allen wins in this case can be expressed as $\frac{1}{6} + \frac{2}{6}p + \frac{3}{6}q$, and thus $p = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{2}{6}p + \frac{3}{6}q$. By a similar analysis for $q$, we find that $q = \frac{1}{6} \cdot 0 + \frac{2}{6}p + \frac{3}{6}q$. Solving, we get $p = \frac{5}{12}$ and $q = \frac{1}{3}$. Allen wins with probability $p = \frac{1}{2}$ if the first roll is 1, 2, or 3, and he wins with probability $q = \frac{1}{3}$ if the first roll is 4, 5, or 6. We conclude that the overall probability that he wins the game is $\frac{1}{2}p + \frac{1}{2}q = \frac{5}{12}$."

Since $(-4)(1)(1) > 0$, there are two roots $ab$, so the product of both possible values of $ab$ is $1$ by Vieta’s."
"Let $V$ be a rectangular prism with integer side lengths. The largest face has area 240 and the smallest face has area 48. A third face has area $x$, where $x$ is not equal to 48 or 240.

Then, we have that $s_1s_2 = 48$ and $s_2s_3 = 240$. Noting that $s_1 \le s_2$, we must have $(s_1, s_2) = (1, 48), (2, 24), (3, 16), (4, 12), (6, 8)$. We must also have $s_2s_3 = 240$ and $s_2 \le s_3$, and the only possibilities for $(s_1, s_2)$ that yield integral $s_3$ that satisfy these conditions are $(4, 12)$, which gives $s_3 = 20$, and $(6, 8)$, which gives $s_3 = 30$. Thus, the only valid $(s_1, s_2, s_3)$ are $(4, 12, 20)$ and $(6, 8, 30)$. It follows that the only possible areas of the third face are $4(20) = 80$ and $6(30) = 180$, so the desired answer is $80 + 180 = 260$."

The numbers 1 − 10 are written in a circle randomly. Find the expected number of numbers which are at least 2 larger than an adjacent number.,"For 1 ≤ i ≤ 10, let Xi be the random variable that is 1 if the i in the circle is at least 2 larger than one of its neighbors, and 0 otherwise. The random variable representing number of numbers that are at least 2 larger than one of their neighbors is then just X1 + X2 + · · · + X10. The expected value E[X1 + X2 + · · · + X10] is equal to E[X1] + E[X2] + · · · + E[X10] by the linearity of expectation, so it suffices to compute E[Xi] for all 1 ≤ i ≤ 10. By the definition of expected value, E[Xi] = 1·P (the i is at least 2 larger than one of its neighbors)+0· P (it is not at least 2 larger than either of its neighbors) = P (the i is at least 2 larger than one of its neighbors) = 1 − P (the i is at most 1 larger than both of its neighbors). For the last probability, i’s neighbors must be drawn from the set {max(1, i − 1), max(1, i − 1) + 1, . . . , 10}, excluding i itself. This set has 10 − max(1, i − 1) elements, so there are a total of $\binom{10−max(1,i−1)}{2}$ possible sets of two neighbors from all of the numbers that satisfy the condition, out of a total of $\binom{9}{2}$ that are not i. The last probability is then $\frac{2\binom{10−max(1,i−1)}{2}}{\binom{9}{2}}$, so E[Xi] = $1 − \frac{2\binom{10−max(1,i−1)}{2}}{\binom{9}{2}}$. The final sum we wish to calculate then becomes $(1− \frac{\binom{9}{2}}{\binom{9}{2}})+(1− \frac{\binom{9}{2}}{\binom{9}{2}})+(1− \frac{\binom{8}{2}}{\binom{9}{2}})+(1− \frac{\binom{7}{2}}{\binom{9}{2}})+· · ·+(1− \frac{\binom{1}{2}}{\binom{9}{2}}) = 0 + 0 + (1 − \frac{28}{36}) + (1 − \frac{21}{36}) + · · · + (1 − 0) = \frac{17}{3}$."
"We want to design a new chess piece, the American, with the property that (i) the American can never attack itself, and (ii) if an American A1 attacks another American A2, then A2 also attacks A1.

Let n be the maximal number of Americans that can be placed on the 8 by 8 chessboard such that no Americans attack each other, if one American must be in the top left corner. Find the largest possible value of mn.","Since one of the Americans must be in the top left corner, that eliminates m squares from consideration for placing additional Americans. So m + n is at most 64, which implies mn can be at most 1024. To achieve 1024, we can color a chessboard the normal way, and say that an American attacks all squares of the opposite color. Then the American in the top left corner attacks the 32 squares of the opposite color, and placing all Americans on the squares of the same color as the top-left corner guarantees no Americans attack each other."
"Define a number to be an anti-palindrome if, when written in base 3 as $a_na_{n-1}...a_0$, then $a_i + a_{n-i} = 2$ for any $0 ≤ i ≤ n$. Find the number of anti-palindromes less than $3^{12}$ such that no two consecutive digits in base 3 are equal.","Note once the middle digit/pair of digits is determined, it suffices to choose the digits in the left half of the number and ensure no pair of consecutive digits are equal. For a number with an even number of digits, the middle pair is 02 or 20 while for a number with an odd number of digits, the middle digit is 1. We can now count recursively. Let $a_n$ be the number of ways to choose n digits no two of which are consecutive and equal such that the leading digit is nonzero and the ending digit is 1. Let $b_n$ be the number ways to do the same such that the ending digit is 0 or 2. Note $a_n = b_{n-1}$. Also $b_n = b_{n-1} + 2a_{n-1}$. Solving for the terms of the sequence, they are $a_1 = 1, a_2 = b_1 = 1, a_3 = b_2 = 3, a_4 = b_3 = 5, a_5 = b_4 = 11, a_6 = b_5 = 21, b_6 = 43$.

Given that $x_0, ..., x_{16}$ are fixed, there is exactly one way to choose $x_{17}$ so that $x_0 + ... + x_{17}$ is congruent to 19 mod 100. Then, this means that the sum equals the total number of ways to choose $x_0, ..., x_{16}$, which equals $100^{17} = 10^{34}$."

"A positive integer $k$ is called powerful if there are distinct positive integers $p, q, r, s, t$ such that $p^2, q^3, r^5, s^7, t^{11}$ all divide $k$. Find the smallest powerful integer.","First of all, 1024 is powerful because it can be divided evenly by $16^2 = 256$, $8^3 = 512$, $4^5 = 1024$, $2^7 = 128$, and $1^{11} = 1$. Now we show that 1024 is the smallest powerful number. Since $s \neq t$, at least one of them is at least 2. If $t \ge 2$ or $s \ge 3$, then we need the number to be divisible by at least $2^{11} = 2048$ or $3^7 = 2187$, which both exceed 1024, so we must have $s = 2$ and $t = 1$. If $r = 3$, then the number must be divisible by $3^5 = 243$ and $2^7 = 128$, which means that the number is at least $243 \cdot 128 > 1024$, so $r \ge 4$, and the number is at least $4^5 = 1024$. Therefore the smallest powerful number is indeed 1024."
"How many sequences of integers $(a_1, \dots, a_7)$ are there for which $-1 \le a_i \le 1$ for every $i$, and $a_1a_2 + a_2a_3 + a_3a_4 + a_4a_5 + a_5a_6 + a_6a_7 = 4$?","For $i = 1, 2, \dots, 6$, let $b_i = a_ia_{i+1}$. From the problem condition each of $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_6$ can only be $-1, 0,$ or $1$. Since the sum of these six numbers is 4, either there are five 1s and a $-1$ or there are four 1s and two 0s. In the first case, there are 6 ways to choose $i$ such that $b_i = -1$. Once that is fixed, determining the value of $a_1$ (one of 1 and -1) will determine the value of all the remaining $a_i$'s, so there are $6 \cdot 2 = 12$ possible ways in this case. In the second case, since if one of $b_2, b_3, b_4, b_5$ is zero, then one of the adjacent term to this zero term must also be zero. Therefore the two zeroes must be next to each other or be $b_1$ and $b_6$. If $b_1 = b_2 = 0$, then $a_2$ must be zero. $a_1$'s value doesn't matter, and $a_3, a_4, \dots, a_7$ must have the same sign. The same goes for $b_5 = b_6 = 0$, giving $3 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 12$ possibilities in these two cases. If $b_i = b_{i+1} = 0$ for $i = 2, 3, 4$, then $a_{i+1}$ must be zero. Moreover, $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_i$ must have the same sign, and so do $a_{i+2}, \dots, a_7$. this gives $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 = 12$ possibilities in these three cases. If $b_1 = b_6 = 0$, then $a_1 = a_7 = 0$. Also, $a_2, a_3, \dots, a_6$ must have the same sign so there are 2 possibilities. Combining these cases gives $12 + 12 + 12 + 2 = 38$ possible sequences in total."
"Michael writes down all the integers between 1 and N inclusive on a piece of paper and discovers that exactly 40% of them have leftmost digit 1. Given that $N > 2017$, find the smallest possible value of N.","Let $d$ be the number of digits of $N$. Suppose that $N$ does not itself have leftmost digit 1. Then the number of integers $1, 2, \dots, N$ which have leftmost digit 1 is $1 + 10 + 10^2 + \dots + 10^{d-1} = \frac{10^d - 1}{9}$, so we must have $\frac{10^d - 1}{9} = \frac{2N}{5}$, or $5(10^d - 1) = 18N$. But the left-hand side is odd, so this is impossible. Thus $N$ must have leftmost digit 1. In this case, the number of integers $1, 2, \dots, N$ which have leftmost digit 1 is $1 + 10 + 10^2 + \dots + 10^{d-2} + (N - 10^{d-1} + 1) = \frac{10^{d-1} - 1}{9} + N - 10^{d-1} + 1 = \frac{N}{5}$. Then, $\frac{10^{d-1} - 1}{9}$ must be divisible by 5, so $10^{d-1} - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{45}$. Since $10^k - 1$ has $k$ ones, $d-1$ must be divisible by 3. Both d = 4 and d = 7 make N less than 2017, but d = 7 gives the answer N = 1481480."
"An equiangular hexagon has side lengths 1, 1, a, 1, 1, a in that order. Given that there exists a circle that intersects the hexagon at 12 distinct points, we have $M < a < N$ for some real numbers $M$ and $N$. Determine the minimum possible value of the ratio $\frac{N}{M}$","We claim that the greatest possible value of M is $\sqrt{3} - 1$, whereas the least possible value of N is 3. To begin, note that the condition requires the circle to intersect each side of the hexagon at two points on its interior. This implies that the center must be inside the hexagon as its projection onto all six sides must be on their interior. Suppose that the hexagon is ABCDEF, with AB = BC = DE = EF = 1, CD = FA = a, and the center O. When $a = \sqrt{3} - 1$, we note that the distance from O to CD (which is $\frac{a}{2}$) is greater than or equal to the distance from O to B or E (which is $\frac{a+1}{2}$). However, for the circle to intersect all six sides at two points each, the distance from the center of the circle to CD and to FA must be strictly less than that from the center to B and to E, because otherwise any circle that intersects CD and FA at two points each must include B or E on its boundary or interior, which will not satisfy the condition. WLOG assume that the center of the circle is closer to FA than to CD, including equality (in other words, the center is on the same side of BE as FA, possibly on BE itself), then note that the parabola with foci B and E and common directrix CD intersects on point O, which means that there does not exist a point in the hexagon on the same side of BE as FA that lies on the same side of both parabola as CD. This means that the center of the circle cannot be chosen. When $a = 2$, the circle with center O and radius $r = \sqrt{3} - 1 + \epsilon$ for some very small real number $\epsilon > 0$ intersects sides AB, BC, DE, EF at two points each and is tangent to CD and FA on their interior. Therefore, there exists a real number $\epsilon' > 0$ such that the circle with center O and radius $r' = r + \epsilon'$ satisfy the requirement. When $a \ge 3$, we note that the projection of BF onto BC has length $|1/2| \ge 1$, which means that the projection of F onto side BC is not on its interior, and the same goes for side EF onto BC. However, for a circle to intersect both BC and EF at two points, the projection of center of the circle onto the two sides must be on their interior, which cannot happen in this case. When $a = 3 - \epsilon$ for some very small real number $\epsilon > 0$, a circle with center O and radius $r = \frac{2 - a \sqrt{3}}{4(a+1)}$ intersects AF and CD at two points each and is tangent to all four other sides on their interior. Therefore, there exists a real number $\epsilon' > 0$ such that the circle with center O and radius $r' = r + \epsilon'$ satisfy the requirement. With $M \le \sqrt{3} - 1$ and $N \ge 3$, we have $\frac{N}{M} \ge \frac{3}{\sqrt{3}-1} = \frac{3(\sqrt{3}+1)}{2} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}+3}{2}$, which is our answer."
"Ashwin the frog is traveling on the $xy$-plane in a series of $2^{2017} - 1$ steps, starting at the origin. At the $n$th step, if $n$ is odd, then Ashwin jumps one unit to the right.

If Ashwin begins at the origin, what is the area of the polygon bounded by Ashwin’s path, the line $x = 2^{2016}$, and the $x$-axis?","Notice that since $v_2(x) = v_2(2^{2017} - x)$, the path divides the rectangle bonded by the coordinate axes and the two lines passing through Ashwin’s final location parallel to the axes. The answer is therefore half of the product of the coordinates of Ashwin’s final coordinates. The x-coordinate is the number of odd number steps (which is $2^{2016}$). The y-coordinate is the number of total powers of 2 in $(2^{2017} - 1)!$. The final answer is therefore $2^{2015} \cdot (2^{2017} - 2018)."
"Consider five-dimensional Cartesian space and consider the hyperplanes with the following equations: $\mathbb{R}^5 = \{(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5) | x_i \in \mathbb{R}\}$, $\bullet$ $x_i = x_j$ for every $1 \le i < j \le 5$; $\bullet$ $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = -1$; $\bullet$ $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 0$; $\bullet$ $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 1$.

Therefore, the first set of planes separate the space into $5! = 120$ regions, with each region representing an ordering of the five coordinates by numerical size. Moreover, the next three planes are parallel to each other and perpendicular to all planes in the first set, so these three planes separate each region into 4. Therefore, a total of $4 \cdot 120 = 480$ regions is created."
"There are 12 students in a classroom; 6 of them are Democrats and 6 of them are Republicans. Every hour the students are randomly separated into four groups of three for political debates. If a group contains students from both parties, the minority in the group will change his/her political alignment to that of the majority at the end of the debate. What is the expected amount of time needed for all 12 students to have the same political alignment, in hours?","When the party distribution is 6 - 6, the situation can change (to 3 - 9) only when a group of three contains three people from the same party, and the remaining three are distributed evenly across the other three groups (to be converted). To compute the probability, we assume that the groups and the members of the group are ordered (so there are 12! ways of grouping). There are 2 ways to choose the party, 4 ways to choose the group, $6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4$ ways to choose the three members of the group, $9 \cdot 6 \cdot 3$ ways to place the other three members of the party, and 6! ways to fill in the members of the other party. The probability is then $\frac{2 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 9 \cdot 6 \cdot 3 \cdot 6!}{12!} = \frac{2 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 9 \cdot 6 \cdot 3}{12 \cdot 11 \cdot 10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7} = \frac{18}{77}$. This means that the shift in distribution will happen in $\frac{77}{18}$ hours on average. When the distribution is 3 - 9, the situation can change (to 0 - 12) only when the three members of the minority party are all in different groups. Using the similar method as above, there are $12 \cdot 9 \cdot 6$ ways to place the three members and 9! ways to place the rest, so the probability is $\frac{12 \cdot 9 \cdot 6 \cdot 9!}{12!} = \frac{12 \cdot 9 \cdot 6}{12 \cdot 11 \cdot 10} = \frac{27}{55}$. This means that the shift in distribution will happen in $\frac{55}{27}$ hours on average. By linearity of expectation, we can add up the two results and get that the expected value is $\frac{77}{18} + \frac{55}{27} = \frac{341}{54}$ hours."

Then $(w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^2 = 4(x^2 - w^2)(y^2 + z^2)$ and since $|x^2 + w^2| \ge |x^2 - w^2|$ it follows that $w = 0$ or $y = z = 0$. Now $y = z = 0$ implies $a = b = c = d = 0$. Now $w = 0$ gives $b = -d$. Then for equality to hold $x^2 = y^2 + z^2$. This is equivalent to $ac = b^2$, which includes the previous case. It suffices to count the number of triples $(a, b, c)$ that satisfy the equation. When $b = 0$, either $a$ or $c$ is zero, which gives $11 + 11 - 1 = 21$ triples. When $b = \pm 1$, we have $|a| = |c| = 1$ and $a, c$ have the same sign, for $2 \cdot 2 = 4$ triples. When $b = \pm 2$, we have $(a, c) = (1, 4), (2, 2), (4, 1)$ or their negatives, for $2 \cdot 6 = 12$ triples. When $b = \pm 3, \pm 4, \pm 5$, we have $|a| = |b| = |c|$ and $a, c$ have the same sign, for $6 \cdot 2 = 12$ triples. So in total there are $21 + 4 + 12 + 12 = 49$ solutions."
"Let A, B, C, D be points chosen on a circle, in that order. Line BD is reflected over lines AB and DA to obtain lines $l_1$ and $l_2$ respectively. If lines $l_1, l_2$, and AC meet at a common point and if AB = 4, BC = 3, CD = 2, compute the length DA.","Let the common point be E. Then since lines BE and BD are symmetric about line BA, BA is an exterior bisector of $\angle DBE$, and similarly DA is also an exterior bisector of $\angle BDE$. Therefore A is the E-excenter of triangle BDE and thus lie on the interior bisector of $\angle BED$. Since C lies on line AE, and by the fact that A, B, C, D are concyclic, we get that $\angle ABC + \angle ADC = 180^\circ$, which implies $\angle ABC = \angle CDA = \frac{\pi}{2}$, and thus $DA^2 = AC^2 - CD^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 - CD^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 - 2^2 = 21$. The length of DA is then $\sqrt{21}$."
Find the sum of all positive integers whose largest proper divisor is 55.,"The largest proper divisor of an integer $n$ is $\frac{n}{p}$, where $p$ is the smallest prime divisor of $n$. So $n = 55p$ for some prime $p$. Since $55 = 5 \cdot 11$, we must have $p \le 5$, so $p = 2, 3, 5$ gives all solutions. The sum of these solutions is $55(2 + 3 + 5) = 550$."
"Determine the sum of all distinct real values of $x$ such that $||\dots||x| + x|\dots| + x| + x| = 1$, where there are 2017 $x$'s in the equation.","Note that $|x + |x|| = 2x$ when $x$ is nonnegative, and is equal to 0 otherwise. Thus, when there are 2017 $x$'s, the expression equals $2017x$ when $x \ge 0$ and $-x$ otherwise, so the two solutions to the equation are $x = -1$ and $\frac{1}{2017}$, and their sum is $-\frac{2016}{2017}$."
"Given that $a, b, c$ are integers with $abc = 60$, and that complex number $\omega \ne 1$ satisfies $\omega^3 = 1$, find the minimum possible value of $|a + b\omega + c\omega^2|$.","Since $\omega^3 = 1$, and $\omega \ne 1$, $\omega$ is a third root of unity. For any complex number $z$, $|z|^2 = z \cdot \bar{z}$. Letting $z = a + b\omega + c\omega^2$, we find that $\bar{z} = a + c\omega + b\omega^2$, and $|z|^2 = a^2 + ab\omega + ac\omega^2 + ab\omega^2 + b^2 + bc\omega + ac\omega + bc\omega^2 + c^2 = (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + (ab + bc + ca)(\omega) + (ab + bc + ca)(\omega^2) = (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (ab + bc + ca) = \frac{1}{2}((a - b)^2 + (b - c)^2 + (c - a)^2)$, where we have used the fact that $\omega^3 = 1$ and that $\omega + \omega^2 = -1$. This quantity is minimized when $a, b$, and $c$ are as close to each other as possible, making $a = 3, b = 4, c = 5$ the optimal choice, giving $|z|^2 = 3$. (A smaller value of $|z|$ requires two of $a, b, c$ to be equal and the third differing from them by at most 2, which is impossible.) So $|z|_{min} = \sqrt{3}$."
Suppose $x$ is a rational number such that $x^2$ is also rational. Find $x$.,"Suppose $x \ne 0$. Then $\sqrt{x}$ is rational if and only if $x$ is the square of a rational number. It is well-known that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. Then $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{x} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{x^2}}$ is the quotient of two nonzero rationals, and so is rational. However, $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. Therefore any solution $x$ must satisfy $x = 0$. We can see that $0^2 = 0$ is rational, so the answer is indeed $x = 0$."
Regular octagon CHILDREN has area 1. Find the area of pentagon CHILD.,"The pentagon CHILD is congruent to the pentagon N ERDC, as their corresponding angles and sides are congruent. Moreover, the two pentagons together compose the entire octagon, so each pentagon must have area one-half of the area of the octagon, or $\frac{1}{2}$."
"The length of a rectangle is three times its width. Given that its perimeter and area are both numerically equal to $k > 0$, find $k$.","Let $a$ be the width of the rectangle. Then the length of the rectangle is $3a$, so the perimeter is $2(a + 3a) = 8a$, and the area is $3a^2$. Since the perimeter and area are numerically equal to $k$, we have $8a = 3a^2 = k$. Because $k > 0$, the rectangle is non-degenerate. It follows that $8 = 3a$, so $a = \frac{8}{3}$. Therefore, $k = 3a^2 = 3\left(\frac{8}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{64}{3}$."
"Alec wishes to construct a string of 6 letters using the letters A, C, G, and N, such that: The first three letters are pairwise distinct, and so are the last three letters; The first, second, fourth, and fifth letters are pairwise distinct. In how many ways can he construct the string?","There are $4! = 24$ ways to decide the first, second, fourth, and fifth letters because these letters can be selected sequentially without replacement from the four possible letters. Once these four letters are selected, there are 2 ways to select the third letter because two distinct letters have already been selected for the first and second letters, leaving two possibilities. The same analysis applies to the sixth letter. Thus, there are $24 \cdot 2^2 = 96$ total ways to construct the string."

"Lunasa, Merlin, and Lyrica each have a distinct hat. Every day, two of these three people, selected randomly, switch their hats. What is the probability that, after 2017 days, every person has their own hat back?","Imagine that the three hats are the vertices of an equilateral triangle. Then each day the exchange is equivalent to reflecting the triangle along one of its three symmetry axes, which changes the orientation of the triangle (from clockwise to counterclockwise or vice versa). Thus, an even number of such exchanges must be performed if the orientation is to be preserved. Since the triangle is reflected 2017 times, it is impossible for the final triangle to have the same orientation as the original triangle, so the desired probability is 0."
Compute $100^2 + 99^2 - 98^2 - 97^2 + 96^2 + 95^2 - 94^2 - 93^2 + \dots + 4^2 + 3^2 - 2^2 - 1^2$.,"Note that $(n+3)^2 - (n+2)^2 - (n+1)^2 + n^2 = 4$ for every $n$. Therefore, adding $0^2$ to the end of the given sum and applying this identity for every four consecutive terms after $100^2$, we see that the given sum is equivalent to $100^2 + 25 \cdot 4 = 10100$. Alternatively, we can apply the difference-of-squares factorization to rewrite $100^2 - 98^2 = (100 - 98)(100 + 98) = 2(100 + 98)$, $99^2 - 97^2 = (99 - 97)(99 + 97) = 2(99 + 97)$, etc. Thus, the given sum is equivalent to $2(100 + 99 + \dots + 2 + 1) = 2 \cdot \frac{100 \cdot 101}{2} = 10100$."
Regular octagon CHILDREN has area 1. Determine the area of quadrilateral LIN E.,"Suppose that the side length CH = $a$, then the area of the octagon is $(2 + \sqrt{2})a^2$, which is exactly one-half of the area of the octagon. Therefore the area of LIN E is $\frac{1}{2}$."
"A malfunctioning digital clock shows the time 9:57 AM; however, the correct time is 10:10 AM. There are two buttons on the clock, one of which increases the time displayed by 9 minutes, and another which decreases the time by 20 minutes. What is the minimum number of button presses necessary to correctly set the clock to the correct time?","We need to increase the time by 13 minutes. If we click the 9 minute button $a$ times and the 20 minute button $b$ times, then we must have $9a - 20b = 13$. Note that if this equation is satisfied, then $b$ increases as $a$ increases, so it suffices to minimize $a$. This means that $a$ must end in a 7. However, since $63 - 20b = 13$ has no integer solution, the next smallest possible value of $a$ is 17, which gives the solution $(a, b) = (17, 7)$, or 24 button presses."
"Triangle ABC has side lengths AB = 15, BC = 18, CA = 20. Extend CA and CB to points D and E respectively such that DA = AB = BE. Line AB intersects the circumcircle of CDE at P and Q. Find the length of PQ.","WLOG suppose that P is closer to A than to B. Let DA = AB = BE = c = 15, BC = a = 18, CA = b = 20, PA = x, and QB = y. By Power of a Point on B and A, we get ac = (x + c)y and bc = (y + c)x, respectively. Subtracting the two equations gives cy − cx = ac − bc ⇒ y − x = a − b. Substituting y = x + a − b into the ﬁrst equation gives ac = (x + c)(x + a − b) = x^2 + (a − b + c)x + ac − bc, which is a quadratic with unique positive solution $x = \frac{\sqrt{(b-a-c)^2 + 4bc} - (a-b+c)}{2}$. Thus, PQ = x+y+c = (y−x)+2x+c = (a−b+c)+ \sqrt{(a − b + c)^2 + 4bc} = \sqrt{13^2 + 4 \cdot 20 \cdot 15} = 37."

Since the condition $\frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{DA}{CD}$ implies AB · CD = BC · DA, we have 2(BC · DA) = 12, so DA = 6/2 = 3."
"Given complex number $z$, define sequence $z_0, z_1, z_2, \dots$ as $z_0 = z$ and $z_{n+1} = 2z_n^2 + 2z_n$ for $n \ge 0$. Given that $z_{10} = 2017$, find the minimum possible value of $|z|$.","Define $w_n = z_n + \frac{1}{2}$, so $z_n = w_n - \frac{1}{2}$, and the original equation becomes $w_{n+1} - \frac{1}{2} = 2(w_n - \frac{1}{2})^2 + 2(w_n - \frac{1}{2}) = 2w_n^2 - \frac{1}{2}$, which reduces to $w_{n+1} = 2w_n^2$. It is not difficult to show that $w_{10} = 2^{1023} w_0^ {1024}$, and thus $w_{10} = z_{10} + \frac{1}{2} = 2017 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{4035}{2} = 2^{1023} w_0^{1024}$, and thus $w_0 = \sqrt[1024]{\frac{4035}{2^{1024}}}$. To minimize the magnitude of $z = w_0 - \frac{1}{2}$, we need $\omega_{1024} = -1$, which gives $|z| = \sqrt[1024]{4035/2} - \frac{1}{2}$."
"Four standard six-sided dice are rolled. Find the probability that, for each pair of dice, the product of the two numbers rolled on those dice is a multiple of 4.","If any two of the dice show an odd number, then this is impossible, so at most one of the dice can show an odd number. We take two cases: Case 1: If exactly one of the dice shows an odd number, then all three other dice must show a multiple of 4, which can only be the number 4. The probability that this occurs is $\frac{4}{6} \cdot (\frac{1}{6})^3 = \frac{4}{1296} = \frac{1}{324}$. Case 2: If all of the dice show even numbers, then the condition is satisfied. The probability that this occurs is $(\frac{1}{2})^4 = \frac{1}{16}$. The total probability is $\frac{1}{324} + \frac{1}{16} = \frac{31}{432}$."

After applying all operations, her score is the minimum distance from her number to any perfect square. What is the maximum score she can attain?","Note that after applying the squaring operation, Alice’s number will be a perfect square, so she can maximize her score by having a large number of adding operations at the end. However, her scores needs to be large enough that the many additions to not bring her close to a larger square. Hence the strategy is as follows: 2 additions to get to 2, 4 consecutive squares to get to 65536, and 94 more additions for a score of 94."
For how many positive integers $n \le 100$ is it true that $10n$ has exactly three times as many positive divisors as $n$ has?,"Let $n = 2^a 5^b c$, where $2, 5 \nmid c$. Then, the ratio of the number of divisors of $10n$ to the number of divisors of $n$ is $\frac{(a+2)(b+2)}{(a+1)(b+1)} = 3$. Solving for $b$, we find that $b = 2 - a$. This forces $(a, b) = (0, 2), (1, 1), (2, 0)$. Therefore, the answers are of the form $2^k$ and $5^k$ whenever $\gcd(k, 10) = 1$. There are 50 positive numbers of the form $2^k$ and 20 positive numbers of the form $5^k$ less than or equal to 100. Of those 70 numbers, only 28 have $k$ relatively prime to 10, so the answer is 28."
Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers greater than 1 such that $ab = 100$. The maximum possible value of $a(\log_{10} b)^2$ can be written in the form $10^x$ for some real number $x$. Find $x$.,"Let $p = \log_{10} a, q = \log_{10} b$. Since $a, b > 1$, $p$ and $q$ are positive. The condition $ab = 100$ translates to $p + q = 2$. We wish to maximize $x = \log_{10} a(\log_{10} b)^2 = (\log_{10} a)(\log_{10} b)^2 = pq^2$. By AM-GM, $pq^2 \le (\frac{p + 2q + 2q}{4})^4 = \frac{81}{16}$. Then $pq^2 \le \frac{32}{27}$ with equality when $p = \frac{2}{3}, q = \frac{4}{3}$."
Find the sum of all positive integers $n$ such that $1 + 2 + \dots + n$ divides $15[(n + 1)^2 + (n + 2)^2 + \dots + (2n)^2]$.,"We can compute that $1 + 2 + \dots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, and $(n + 1)^2 + (n + 2)^2 + \dots + (2n)^2 = \frac{n(2n+1)(7n+1)}{6}$, so we need $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ to divide $15\frac{n(2n+1)(7n+1)}{6}$. This simplifies to $\frac{5(2n+1)(7n+1)}{n+1}$ to be an integer. The remainder when $(2n + 1)(7n + 1)$ is divided by $(n + 1)$ is 6, so we need $\frac{30}{n+1}$ to be an integer. The solutions are one less than a divisor of 30 so the answer is $1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 9 + 14 + 29 = 64$."
"Triangle $\triangle PQR$, with $PQ = PR = 5$ and $QR = 6$, is inscribed in circle $\omega$. Compute the radius of the circle with center on $QR$ which is tangent to both $\omega$ and $PQ$.","Let the second circle be $\gamma$. Let $T$ and $r$ be the center and radius of $\gamma$, respectively, and let $X$ and $H$ be the tangency points of $\gamma$ with $\omega$ and $PQ$, respectively. Let $O$ be the center of $\omega$, and let $M$ be the midpoint of $QR$. Note that $QM = MR = \frac{1}{2} QR = 3$, so $\triangle PMQ$ and $\triangle PMR$ are 3-4-5 triangles. The circumradius of $\triangle PQR$ is $OP = \frac{25}{8}$. Also, we have $OT = OX - XT = \frac{25}{8} - r$. Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem, $(\frac{25}{8} - r)^2 = (\frac{25}{8})^2 - (4r)^2$. This simplifies to $9r^2 - 10r = 0$, so $r = \frac{20}{9}$."
What is the largest factor of 130000 that does not contain the digit 0 or 5?,"If the number is a multiple of 5, then its units digit will be either 0 or 5. Hence, the largest such number must have no factors of 5. We have $130000 = 2^4 \cdot 5^4 \cdot 13$. Removing every factor of 5, we get that our number must be a factor of $2^4 \cdot 13 = 208$. If our number contains a factor of 13, we cancel the factor of 2 from 208, 104, and 52 until we get 26. Otherwise, the largest number we can have is $2^4 = 16$. We conclude that the answer is 26."

Andrew is equally likely to occupy any of these spots, so our answer is $\frac{8}{17}$."
"A square in the $xy$-plane has area $A$, and three of its vertices have $x$-coordinates 2, 0, and 18 in some order. Find the sum of all possible values of $A$.","More generally, suppose three vertices of the square lie on lines $y = y_1$, $y = y_2$, $y = y_3$. One of these vertices must be adjacent to two others. If that vertex is on $y = y_1$ and the other two are on $y = y_2$ and $y = y_3$, then we can use the Pythagorean theorem to get that the square of the side length is $(y_2 - y_1)^2 + (y_3 - y_1)^2$. For $(y_1, y_2, y_3) = (2, 0, 18)$, the possibilities are $2^2 + 16^2$, $2^2 + 18^2$, $16^2 + 18^2$, so the sum is $2(2^2 + 16^2 + 18^2) = 2(4 + 256 + 324) = 1168$."
Find the number of eight-digit positive integers that are multiples of 9 and have all distinct digits.,"Note that $0 + 1 + \cdots + 9 = 45$. Consider the two unused digits, which must then add up to 9. If it’s 0 and 9, there are $8 \cdot 7!$ ways to finish; otherwise, each of the other four pairs give $7 \cdot 7!$ ways to finish, since 0 cannot be the first digit. This gives a total of $36 \cdot 7! = 181440$."
Compute the smallest positive integer $n$ for which $\sqrt{100 + \sqrt{n}} + \sqrt{100 - \sqrt{n}}$ is an integer.,"The number $\sqrt{100 + \sqrt{n}} + \sqrt{100 - \sqrt{n}}$ is a positive integer if and only if its square is a perfect square. $(\sqrt{100 + \sqrt{n}} + \sqrt{100 - \sqrt{n}})^2 = (100 + \sqrt{n}) + (100 - \sqrt{n}) + 2\sqrt{10000 - n} = 200 + 2\sqrt{10000 - n}$. To minimize $n$, we should maximize the value of this expression, given that it is a perfect square. For this expression to be a perfect square, $10000 - n$ must be a perfect square. Then $200 + 2\sqrt{10000 - n}$ is a perfect square. Solving $200 + 2\sqrt{10000 - n} = 18^2 = 324$ for $n$ gives the answer, $n = 6156$."
Call a polygon normal if it can be inscribed in a unit circle. How many non-congruent normal polygons are there such that the square of each side length is a positive integer?,"The side lengths of the polygon can only be from the set $\{1, \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, 2\}$, which take up $60^\circ$, $90^\circ$, $120^\circ$, $180^\circ$ of the circle respectively. By working modulo 60 degrees we see that $\sqrt{2}$ must be used an even number of times. We now proceed to casework on the longest side of the polygon. Adding up all cases, we have $3 + 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 14$ polygons."

Since $\frac{a}{\sqrt{b}}\sqrt{15!} = a\sqrt{\frac{15!}{b}} = a\frac{\sqrt{15!}}{\sqrt{a}}$, we have $q = \frac{1}{15!}\sum_{a,b:\sqrt{b} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{15!}}} ab = \frac{1}{15!} \sum_{a|30240} a = 4$."

If $x, y, z$ are all positive or all negative then the equation is obviously true. Otherwise, since flipping the signs of all three variables or permuting them does not change the equality, we assume WLOG that $x, y > 0$ and $z < 0$. If $x + y + z > 0$, then the LHS of the original equation becomes $x + y - z + x + y + z = 2x + 2y$, and the RHS becomes $x + y + |x + z| + |y + z|$, so we need $|x + z| + |y + z| = x + y$. But this is impossible when $-x - y < z < 0$. If $x + y + z < 0$, then $x + z, y + z < 0$ as well, so the LHS of the original equation becomes $x + y - z - x - y - z = -2z$ and the RHS becomes $x + y - x - z - y - z = -2z$. In this case, the equality holds true. Thus, we seek the volume of all points $(x, y, z) \in [0, 1]^3$ that satisfy $x + y - z < 0$. This pyramid has volume $\frac{1}{6}$.

This occurs when $N = 2018$ and item $i$ was voted to student 1, 1, 2, 3, ..., 2018 by student $2i-1, 2i-2, ..., 2019, 1, ..., 2i-2$ respectively for $i = 1, 2, ..., 2018$. Thus, the maximum possible number of items one student can receive is 1009."
"The coefficients of the polynomial $P(x)$ are nonnegative integers, each less than 100. Given that $P(10) = 331633$ and $P(-10) = 273373$, compute $P(1)$.","Let $P(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + ...$. Then $\frac{1}{2}(P(10) + P(-10)) = a_0 + 100a_2 + ...$ and $\frac{1}{2}(P(10) - P(-10)) = 10a_1 + 1000a_3 + ...$. Since all the coefficients are nonnegative integers, these expressions give us each of the coefficients by just taking two digits in succession. Thus we have $a_0 = 3, a_1 = 13, a_2 = 25, a_3 = 29, a_4 = 30$ and $a_n = 0$ for $n > 4$. Thus $P(1) = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + ... = 100."
"Two players play a game, starting with a pile of $N$ tokens. On each player’s turn, they must remove $2^n$ tokens from the pile for some nonnegative integer $n$. If a player cannot make a move, they lose. For how many $N$ between 1 and 2019 (inclusive) does the first player have a winning strategy?","The first player has a winning strategy if and only if $N$ is not a multiple of 3. We show this by induction on $N$. If $N = 0$, then the first player loses. If $N$ is a multiple of 3, then $N - 2^n$ is never a multiple of 3 for any $n$, so the second player has a winning strategy. If $N$ is not a multiple of 3, the first player can remove either 1 or 2 coins to get the number of coins in the pile down to a multiple of 3, so the first player will always win."
Compute the sum of all positive real numbers $x \le 5$ satisfying $x = \lfloor x^2 \rfloor + \frac{\lfloor x \rfloor \cdot \lceil x \rceil}{\lfloor x \rfloor + \lceil x \rceil}$,"Note that all integer $x$ work. If $x$ is not an integer then suppose $n < x < n + 1$. Then $x = n + \frac{k}{2n+1}$, where $n$ is an integer and $1 \le k \le 2n$ is also an integer, since the denominator of the fraction on the right hand side is $2n + 1$. We now show that all $x$ of this form work. Note that $x^2 = n^2 + \frac{2nk}{2n+1} + (\frac{k}{2n+1})^2 = n^2 + k - \frac{k^2}{2n+1} + (\frac{k}{2n+1})^2$. For $k$ between 0 and 1, $-\frac{k}{2n+1} + (\frac{k}{2n+1})^2$ is between $-\frac{1}{4}$ and 0, so we have $n^2 + k - 1 < x^2 \le n^2 + k$, Then, $\lfloor x^2 \rfloor + \frac{\lfloor x \rfloor \cdot \lceil x \rceil}{\lfloor x \rfloor + \lceil x \rceil} = n^2 + k + \frac{n \cdot (n+1)}{2n+1} = n + \frac{k}{2n+1} = x$, so all $x$ of this form work. Now, note that the $2n$ solutions in the interval $(n, n + 1)$, together with the solution $n + 1$, form an arithmetic progression with $2n + 1$ terms and average value $n + \frac{n+1}{2n+1}$. Thus, the sum of the solutions in the interval $(n, n + 1]$ is $n^2 + (n+1)^2$. Summing this for $n$ from 0 to 4, we get that the answer is $0^2 + 2(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2) + 5^2 = 85$."
"Dylan has a $100 \times 100$ square, and wants to cut it into pieces of area at least 1. Each cut must be a straight line (not a line segment) and must intersect the interior of the square. What is the largest number of cuts he can make?","Since each piece has area at least 1 and the original square has area 10000, Dylan can end up with at most 10000 pieces. There is initially 1 piece, so the number of pieces can increase by at most 9999. Each cut increases the number of pieces by at least 1, so Dylan can make at most 9999 cuts. Notice that this is achievable if Dylan makes 9999 vertical cuts spaced at increments of $\frac{1}{100}$ units. The largest number of cuts is $\boxed{9999}$."
"Meghana writes two (not necessarily distinct) primes $q$ and $r$ in base 10 next to each other on a blackboard, resulting in the concatenation of $q$ and $r$ (for example, if $q = 13$ and $r = 5$, the number on the blackboard is now 135). She notices that three more than the resulting number is the square of a prime $p$. Find all possible values of $p$.","Trying $p = 2$, we see that $p^2 - 3 = 1$ is not the concatenation of two primes, so $p$ must be odd. Then $p^2 - 3$ is even. Since $r$ is prime and determines the units digit of the concatenation of $q$ and $r$, $r$ must be 2. Then $p^2$ will have units digit 5, which means that $p$ will have units digit 5. Since $p$ is prime, we find that $p$ can only be 5, and in this case, $p^2 - 3 = 22$ allows us to set $q = r = 2$ to satisfy the problem statement. So there is a valid solution when $p = 5$, and this is the only possibility. The only possible value of $p$ is $\boxed{5}$."
"Katie has a fair 2019-sided die with sides labeled 1, 2, ..., 2019. After each roll, she replaces her $n$-sided die with an $(n + 1)$-sided die having the $n$ sides of her previous die and an additional side with the number she just rolled. What is the probability that Katie’s 2019th roll is a 2019?","Since Katie’s original die is fair, the problem is perfectly symmetric. So on the 2019th roll, each number is equally probable as any other. Therefore, the probability of rolling a 2019 is just $\frac{1}{2019}$. The probability is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2019}}$."

Yannick draws three regular $n$-gons in the plane of $\triangle ABC$ so that each $n$-gon shares a side with a distinct side of $\triangle ABC$ and no two of the $n$-gons overlap. What is the maximum possible value of $n$?","If any $n$-gon is drawn on the same side of one side of $\triangle ABC$ as $\triangle ABC$ itself, it will necessarily overlap with another triangle whenever $n > 3$. Thus either $n = 3$ or the triangles are all outside ABC. The interior angle of a regular $n$-gon is $\frac{180^\circ \cdot (n-2)}{n}$, so we require $\frac{360^\circ \cdot (n - 2)}{n} + \max(\angle A, \angle B, \angle C) < 360^\circ$. As $\triangle ABC$ is almost equilateral (in fact the largest angle is less than $60.1^\circ$), each angle is approximately $60^\circ$, so we require $\frac{360 \cdot (n - 2)}{n} < 300 \implies n < 12$. Hence the answer is $n = \boxed{11}$."

How many nonzero tricky teeny polynomials are there?,"If a degree 0 polynomial has 4 as a root, then it must be the constant zero polynomial. Thus, we will only consider polynomials of degree 1. If $P$ has degree 1, integer coefficients, and 4 as a root, then it must be of the form $P(x) = a(x - 4) = ax - 4a$ for some nonzero integer $a$. Since all integer coefficients are between $-7$ and $7$, inclusive, we require $-7 \le 4a \le 7$, which gives us $a = -1, 1$. Note that for both values, the coefficient of $x$ is also between $-7$ and $7$, so there are 2 tricky teeny polynomials."

You can jump at most 4 feet, but you have one stone you can throw into the river; after it is placed, you may jump to that stone and, if possible, from there to the other side of the river. However, you are not very accurate and the stone ends up landing uniformly at random in the river. What is the probability that you can get across?","To be able to cross, the stone must land between 2 and 4 feet from the river bank you are standing on. Therefore the probability is $\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$."
For how many positive integers $a$ does the polynomial $x^2 - ax + a$ have an integer root?,"Let $r, s$ be the roots of $x^2 - ax + a = 0$. By Vieta’s, we have $r + s = rs = a$. Note that if one root is an integer, then both roots must be integers, as they sum to an integer $a$. Then, $rs - (r + s) + 1 = 1 \implies (r - 1)(s - 1) = 1$. Because we require $r, s$ to be both integers, we have $r - 1 = s - 1 = \pm 1$, which yields $r = s = 0, 2$. If $r = 0$ or $s = 0$, then $a = 0$, but we want $a$ to be a positive integer. Therefore, our only possibility is when $r = s = 2$, which yields $a = 4$, so there is exactly 1 value of $a$ (namely, $a = 4$) such that $x^2 - ax - a$ has an integer root."
"One of the digits, labeled by an underscore, is missing. What is that digit?","Let the missing digit be $x$. Then, taking the equation modulo 10, we see that $2 \equiv -x^3 + 5^3 + 1^3$. This simplifies to $x^3 \equiv 4 \pmod{10}$, which gives a unique solution of $x = 4$."
"A point P is chosen uniformly at random inside a square of side length 2.

We see that if $P_1$ is the reflection of P over AB, then the area of $P_1AB$ is the same as the area of $PAB$. Furthermore, if $P_4$ is the reflection of P over DA, $P_1$, A, and $P_4$ are collinear, as A is the midpoint of $P_1P_4$. Repeating this argument for the other points gives us that the desired area is $[P_1AB] + [P_2BC] + [P_3CD] + [P_4DA] + [ABCD] = [PAB] + [PBC] + [PCD] + [PDA] + [ABCD] = 2[ABCD] = 8$."

Consider the contribution from any one of those digits. If we set that digit to 1, then the remaining 10 digits can be set in $2^9 = 512$ ways so that the number of 1’s is even. Therefore the answer is $512(2^{10} + \dots + 2^{10}) = 512 \cdot 2047 = 1048064$."
Let $S$ be the set of all nondegenerate triangles formed from the vertices of a regular octagon with side length 1. Find the ratio of the largest area of any triangle in $S$ to the smallest area of any triangle in $S$.,"By a smoothing argument, the largest triangle is that where the sides span 3, 3, and 2 sides of the octagon respectively (i.e. it has angles $45^\circ$, $67.5^\circ$, and $67.5^\circ$), and the smallest triangle is that formed by three adjacent vertices of the octagon. Scaling so that the circumradius of the octagon is 1, our answer is $\frac{\sqrt{1 + \sqrt{2}}}{2 - 1} = \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{2}} = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}$, where the numerator is derived from splitting the large triangle by the circumradii, and the denominator is derived from adding the areas of the two triangles formed by the circumradii, then subtracting the area not in the small triangle."

The number of pairs $(X, Y)$ for which X and Y look the same is $1 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 2 + \dots + 8 \cdot 8 = 204$, and these pairs include all the ones in which X and Y are identical. As X and Y are chosen uniformly and independently, all 204 pairs are equally likely to be chosen, thus the problem reduces to choosing one of the 36 pairs in 204, the probability for which is $\frac{36}{204} = \frac{3}{17}$."

Given that there are constants $a, b$ such that the expected value of the value written on the blackboard after $t$ minutes can be written as $at + b$ for all positive integers $t$, compute $p$.","If the blackboard has the value $x$ written on it, then the expected value of the value after one flip is $f(x) = p(3x - 1) + (1 - p)x/2$. Because this expression is linear, we can say the same even if we only know the blackboard’s initial expected value is $x$. Therefore, if the blackboard value is $x_0$ at time 0, then after $t$ minutes, the expected blackboard value is $f^t(x_0)$. We are given that $x_0, f(x_0), f^2(x_0), \dots$ is an arithmetic sequence, so for there to be a constant difference, we must have $f(x) = x + c$ for some $c$.

By the Law of Sines, $\frac{BP}{\sin \alpha} = \frac{AP}{\sin \angle ABC}$. Also, $\frac{CP}{\sin 2\alpha} = \frac{AP}{\sin \angle ACB}$. Since $\angle ABC = \angle ACB$, we have $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sin \alpha} = \frac{1}{\sin 2\alpha}$, which simplifies to $\cos \alpha = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Thus $\alpha = \pi/6$.

If $\lfloor x \rfloor = k$ for some $k > 0$, $x \to x\lfloor x \rfloor = xk$ is a continuous and increasing function on the interval $[k, k+1)$. Therefore, the $x\lfloor x \rfloor$ can take on any value in $[kk, (k+1)k)$ when $\lfloor x \rfloor = k$. Because $24^2 < 1000 < 25^2$, it suffices to count the number of integers in the interval $[kk, (k+1)k)$ for $1 \le k \le 31$.

If the difference between the areas of the largest and smallest of these regions is $d$, compute $240d$.","By checking all the possibilities, one can show that $T$ has height 4 and base lengths 4 and 5. Orient $T$ so that the shorter base is on the top. Then, the length of the cut parallel to the bases is $\frac{4+5}{2} = \frac{9}{2}$. The top two pieces are trapezoids with height 2 and base lengths $\frac{4}{2}$ and $\frac{5}{2}$, while the bottom two pieces are trapezoids with height 2 and base lengths 2 and $\frac{9}{2}$. Thus, using the area formula for a trapezoid, the difference between the largest and smallest areas is $d = \left(\frac{5/2 + 9/2}{2}\right) \cdot 2 - \left(\frac{4/2 + 5/2}{2}\right) \cdot 2 = \frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, $240d = 240(\frac{1}{2}) = 120$."
"Jody has 6 distinguishable balls and 6 distinguishable sticks, all of the same length. How many ways are there to use the sticks to connect the balls so that two disjoint non-interlocking triangles are formed? Consider rotations and reflections of the same arrangement to be indistinguishable.","There are $\binom{6}{3}$ ways to pick the 3 balls for the first triangle. Once we choose the 3 balls for the first triangle, the remaining 3 balls must form the vertices of the second triangle. There are $3!$ ways to arrange the sticks in the first triangle and $3!$ ways to arrange the sticks in the second triangle. This gives $(3!)^2$ ways to arrange the sticks. Since the order of the two triangles doesn’t matter, we must divide by 2 to correct for overcounting. Hence the final answer is $\binom{6}{3} \cdot (3!)^2/2 = 20 \cdot 36 / 2 = 360$.  This appears incorrect in the provided text."
"Nine fair coins are flipped independently and placed in the cells of a 3 by 3 square grid. Let $p$ be the probability that no row has all its coins showing heads and no column has all its coins showing tails. If $p = \frac{a}{b}$ for relatively prime positive integers $a$ and $b$, compute $100a + b$.","Let $q$ be the probability that some row has all heads. By symmetry, $q$ is also the probability that some column has all tails. We can then conclude that $p = 1 - 2q$. The probability that a given row does not have all heads is $1 - \frac{1}{2^3} = \frac{7}{8}$. So, the probability that none of the three rows have all heads is $\left(\frac{7}{8}\right)^3 = \frac{343}{512}$. Thus $q = 1 - \frac{343}{512} = \frac{169}{512}$. Then $p = 1 - 2q = 1 - 2(\frac{169}{512}) = \frac{174}{512} = \frac{87}{256}$. Therefore, $100a + b = 100(87) + 256 = 8700 + 256 = 8956$."

Subtracting twice the second equation from the first, we get $-3a \equiv -14 \pmod{13}$, which simplifies to $a \equiv 9 \pmod{13}$. Therefore we must have $a = 9$ or $a = 22$. Thus the answer is $9 + 22 = 31$."

If $r$ is the smallest possible radius of the sphere, compute $r^2$.","Let $(x, y, z)$ be the center of the sphere. Then $(x - 2)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = x^2 + (y - 4)^2 + z^2 = x^2 + y^2 + (z - 6)^2$. This simplifies to $4x - 4 = 8y - 16 = 12z - 36$, which means $x - 1 = 2(y - 2) = 3(z - 3)$. Thus $(x, y, z) = (1 + 6t, 2 + 3t, 3 + 2t)$ for some integer $t$. For $t = 0$, the sphere passes through the origin. For $t = -1$, we have $(-5, -1, 1)$, and $r^2 = (-5-2)^2 + (-1)^2 + 1^2 = 51$.

In order for Ainsley to win, she needs event X to happen consecutively; meanwhile, Buddy just needs Y then X to occur. Thus, if Y occurs in the first two rolls, Buddy will be guaranteed to win, since the next time X happens, it will have been preceded by an X.

"If $x, y, z$ are real numbers such that $xy = 6$, $xz = 2$, and $x + y + z = 9$, compute $\frac{xy - z}{x - z^2} \frac{xy}{xz}$.","We have $xy = 6$, $xz = 2$, and $x + y + z = 9$. Then $y = \frac{6}{x}$ and $z = \frac{2}{x}$. Substituting into $x + y + z = 9$, we get $x + \frac{6}{x} + \frac{2}{x} = 9$, so $x^2 + 8 = 9x$, which gives $x^2 - 9x + 8 = 0$. This factors as $(x - 1)(x - 8) = 0$, so $x = 1$ or $x = 8$. If $x = 1$, then $y = 6$ and $z = 2$. If $x = 8$, then $y = \frac{3}{4}$ and $z = \frac{1}{4}$.

"A fair coin is flipped eight times in a row.

If $p = \frac{a}{b}$, where $a, b$ are relatively prime positive integers, compute $100a + b$.","Separate the sequence of coin flips into alternating blocks of heads and tails. Of the blocks of heads, exactly one block has length 2, and all other blocks have length 1. The same statement applies to blocks of tails. Thus, if there are $k$ blocks in total, there are $k$ blocks of length 2, leading to $k + 2$ coins in total. We conclude that $k = 6$, meaning that there are 3 blocks of heads and 3 blocks of tails. The blocks of heads must have lengths 1, 1, 2 in some order, and likewise for tails. There are $3! = 6$ ways to choose these two orders, and 2 ways to assemble these blocks into a sequence, depending on whether the first coin flipped is heads or tails.

We have $\binom{15}{b} = \binom{15}{15-b} = 3003$, so $\frac{15!}{b!(15-b)!} = 3003$. Since $3003 = 3 \times 7 \times 11 \times 13$, we must have $b = 5$ or $b = 10$.

The third best team must have lost to either the best or the second-best team, so it must either be marginal or have lost to a marginal team. Since there is exactly one marginal team that won $k$ games for each integer $0 \le k \le 8$, we can then conclude that there are $1 + 2 + \dots + 9 = 45$ teams that are either marginal or lost to a marginal team.

What is the expected number of darts she has to throw before all the darts are within 10 units of the center?","Consider an individual dart. There is a $\frac{1}{4}$ probability it is already within 10 units of the center. If not, for every throw there is a $\frac{1}{4}$ probability it is not thrown again. Thus, if E is the expected value of times it is thrown, we find $E = 1 + \frac{3}{4}E \implies E = 4$. As a result, the expected number of times each dart is thrown is 4. By linearity of expectation, the answer is $2020 \times 3 = 6060$."

Compute the number of positive integers less than 10! which can be expressed as the sum of at most 4 (not necessarily distinct) factorials.,"Since 0! = 1! = 1, we ignore any possible 0!’s in our sums. Call a sum of factorials reduced if for all positive integers k, the term k! appears at most k times. It is straightforward to show that every positive integer can be written uniquely as a reduced sum of factorials. Moreover, by repeatedly replacing k + 1 occurrences of k! with (k + 1)!, every non-reduced sum of factorials is equal to a reduced sum with strictly fewer terms, implying that the aforementioned reduced sum associated to a positive integer n in fact uses the minimum number of factorials necessary. It suffices to compute the number of nonempty reduced sums involving at most 4 terms. By stars and bars, the total number of such sums, ignoring the reduced condition, is $\binom{13}{4} = 714$. The sums that are not reduced must either contain two copies of 1!, three copies of 2!, or four copies of 3!. Note that at most one of these conditions is true, so we can count them separately. If k terms are fixed, there are $\binom{13-k}{4-k}$ ways to choose the rest of the terms, meaning that we must subtract $\binom{11}{3} + \binom{10}{2} + \binom{9}{1} = 165 + 45 + 9 = 219$ terms.

Since $a_1 + a_2$ must be an odd perfect square, we must have $a_1 + a_2 \equiv 1 \pmod 8$, so $a_2 \equiv 0 \pmod 8$. Similarly, since $a_2 + a_3$ is an odd perfect square, we must have $a_3 \equiv 1 \pmod 8$. We can continue this to get $a_{2k-1} \equiv 1 \pmod 8$ and $a_{2k} \equiv 0 \pmod 8$. Now, note that we can find some large enough odd perfect square $t^2$ such that $a_2 = t^2 - 1$. Then, $a_1 + a_2 = 1 + t^2 - 1 = t^2$. Similarly, if $a_3 = t^2 - (2k+1)^2$ for some integer k, then $a_2 + a_3 = t^2 - (2k + 1)^2 + a_2 = t^2 - (2k+1)^2 + t^2 - 1 = 2t^2 - (2k+1)^2 - 1$.

Then $f(f(x)) = a^2x + 2022a + 2022$ and $g(g(x)) = a^2x + 2020a - 2020$. Since $f(f(x)) = g(g(x))$, we have $2022a + 2022 = 2020a - 2020$, which gives $2a = -4042$, so $a = -2021$. Therefore, $f(x) = -2021x + 2022$, and $f(1) = 1$.\newline Alternatively, since $f(x) + g(x) = 2$, the graphs of $y = f(x)$ and $y = g(x)$ must intersect. Let $a$ be the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point. Then $f(a) = g(a) = 1$. Since $f(f(x)) = g(g(x))$, $f(1) = g(1)$. Also, $f(1) + g(1) = 2$, so $2f(1) = 2$, which implies $f(1) = 1$."
What is the smallest $r$ such that three disks of radius $r$ can completely cover a unit disk?,"Let $r$ be the radius of the three disks. Consider the circumference of the unit disk. Each of the three disks must cover at least $\frac{1}{3}$ of the circumference. The length of the chord covered by a disk of radius $r$ is $2\sqrt{r^2 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2}$. We need $3\left(2\sqrt{r^2 - \frac{1}{4}}\right) \ge 2\pi$, which simplifies to $\sqrt{r^2 - \frac{1}{4}} \ge \frac{\pi}{3}$. This gives $r^2 \ge \frac{1}{4} + \frac{\pi^2}{9} \approx 1.27$, so $r \approx 1.1$. However, this is an approximation. To get a lower bound, we place the centers of the three disks symmetrically at a distance of $\frac{1}{2}$ from the center of the unit disk. The distance between the centers is $\sqrt{3}\frac{1}{2}$. Then $r = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. This bound is achievable."
"Find the number of ordered pairs $(A, B)$ such that $A$ and $B$ are disjoint subsets of $\{1, 2, \dots, 50\}$, $|A| = |B| = 25$, and the median of $B$ is 1 more than the median of $A$.","Let $a$ and $b$ be the medians of $A$ and $B$ respectively. Since $|A| = |B| = 25$, there are 12 elements in $A$ less than $a$ and 12 elements in $B$ less than $b$. Since $b = a + 1$, both $a$ and $b$ are greater than 24 numbers in $\{1, \dots, 50\} \setminus \{a, b\}$. Thus, $a = 25$ and $b = 26$. The number of ways to choose 24 numbers from $\{1, \dots, 50\} \setminus \{25, 26\}$ and divide them into two groups of 12 is $\binom{48}{12}\binom{36}{12} = \binom{48}{12}^2$. The number of ways to choose 24 numbers from $\{1, \dots, 50\} \setminus \{25, 26\}$ is $\binom{48}{24}$. Thus, the answer is $\binom{24}{12}^2$. "
"You start with a single piece of chalk of length 1. Every second, you choose a piece of chalk uniformly at random and break it in half. You continue this until you have 8 pieces of chalk. What is the probability that they all have length $\frac{1}{8}$?","There are a total of $7!$ ways to break the chalk into 8 pieces. To obtain 8 pieces of length $\frac{1}{8}$, we must break the chalk in half 7 times, always choosing the largest piece. There is only 1 way to do this.

"A triple of positive integers $(a, b, c)$ is tasty if $\text{lcm}(a, b, c) | a + b + c - 1$ and $a < b < c$. Find the sum of $a + b + c$ across all tasty triples.","If $\text{lcm}(a, b, c) | a + b + c - 1$, then $c | a + b + c - 1$, which implies $c | a + b - 1$. Since $a + b - 1 < 2c$, we must have $a + b - 1 = c$. Then $b | a + c - 1 = 2a - 1$ and $a | c + b - 1 = 2b - 1$. Thus $b | 2a - 1$ and $a | 2b - 1$. If $a = 2$, then $b = 3$, $c = 4$, and $\text{lcm}(2, 3, 4) = 12$, but $12 \nmid 8$. If $a = 3$, then $b = 4$, $c = 6$. $\text{lcm}(3, 4, 6) = 12$, and $12 | 12$. If $a = 6$, then $b = 10$, $c = 15$. $\text{lcm}(6, 10, 15) = 30$, and $30 | 30$. The sum is $3 + 4 + 6 + 6 + 10 + 15 = 44$."
"Emily’s broken clock runs backwards at five times the speed of a regular clock. Right now, it is displaying the wrong time. How many times will it display the correct time in the next 24 hours?","When comparing Emily’s clock with a normal clock, the difference between the two times decreases by 6 seconds for every 1 second that passes. Since this difference is treated as 0 whenever it is a multiple of 12 hours, the two clocks must agree once every 12/6 = 2 hours. Thus, in a 24 hour period it will agree 12 times."
"How many ways are there to arrange the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 on the vertices of a regular hexagon such that exactly 3 of the numbers are larger than both of their neighbors?","Label the vertices of the hexagon abcdef. The numbers that are larger than both of their neighbors can’t be adjacent, so assume (by rotation) that these numbers take up slots ace. We also have that 6 and 5 cannot be smaller than both of their neighbors, so assume (by rotation and reflection) that a = 6 and c = 5. Now, we need to insert 1, 2, 3, 4 into b, d, e, f such that e is the largest among d, e, f. There are 4 ways to choose b, which uniquely determines e, and 2 ways to choose the ordering of d, f, giving 4 · 2 = 8 total ways."
"Let ABCD be a rectangle with AB = 8 and AD = 20. Two circles of radius 5 are drawn with centers in the interior of the rectangle - one tangent to AB and AD, and the other passing through both C and D. What is the area inside the rectangle and outside of both circles?","Let O1 and O2 be the centers of the circles, and let M be the midpoint of CD. We can see that $\triangle O_2MC$ and $\triangle O_2MD$ are both 3-4-5 right triangles. Now let C′ be the intersection of circle O2 and BC (that isn’t C), and let D′ be the intersection of circle O2 and AD (that isn’t D). We know that AD′ = BC′ = 14 because BC′ = 2O2M = 6. All of the area of ABCD that lies outside circle O2 must lie within rectangle ABC′D′ because C′CDD′ is completely covered by circle O2. Now, notice that the area of circle O2 that lies inside ABC′D′ is the same as the area of circle O1 that lies outside ABC′D′. Thus, the total area of ABC′D′ that is covered by either of the two circles is exactly the area of one of the circles, 25π. The remaining area is 8 · 14 − 25π, which is our answer."
"Let $x < 0.1$ be a positive real number. Let the foury series be $4 + 4x + 4x^2 + 4x^3 + \dots$, and let the fourier series be $4 + 44x + 444x^2 + 4444x^3 + \dots$. Suppose that the sum of the fourier series is four times the sum of the foury series. Compute x.",The sum of the foury series can be expressed as $\frac{4}{1-x}$ by geometric series. The fourier series can be expressed as $4\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \sum_{k=0}^n 10^k x^n = 4\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{10^{n+1}-1}{9}x^n = \frac{4}{9} \left( \frac{10}{1-10x} - \frac{1}{1-x} \right)$. Now we solve for x in the equation $\frac{4}{9} \left( \frac{10}{1-10x} - \frac{1}{1-x} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{4}{1-x}$ by multiplying both sides by $(1 - 10x)(1 - x)$. We get $x = \frac{3}{40}$.
"An apartment building consists of 20 rooms numbered 1, 2, ..., 20 arranged clockwise in a circle. To move from one room to another, one can either walk to the next room clockwise (i.e. from room i to room (i + 1) (mod 20)) or walk across the center to the opposite room (i.e. from room i to room (i + 10) (mod 20)). Find the number of ways to move from room 10 to room 20 without visiting the same room twice.","One way is to walk directly from room 10 to 20. Else, divide the rooms into 10 pairs A0 = (10, 20), A1 = (1, 11), A2 = (2, 12), ..., A9 = (9, 19). Notice that each move is either between rooms in Ai and A(i+1) (mod 10) for some i ∈ {0, 1, ..., 9}, or between rooms in the same pair, meaning that our path must pass through A0, A1, ..., A9 in that order before coming back to room 20 in A0, in each of the pairs A1, A2, ..., A8, we can choose to walk between rooms in that pair 0 or 1 times, and we have to walk between rooms 9 and 19 if and only if we first reach A9 at room 9 (so the choice of walking between A9 is completely determined by previous choices). Thus, the number of ways to walk from room 10 to 20 is $1 + 2^8 = 257$."

Find the area of the circumcircle of $\triangle AFN$.","Note that $\angle ACD = \angle ACB + \angle BCD = 60^\circ + 90^\circ = 150^\circ$. In a dodecagon, each interior angle is $180^\circ \cdot \frac{10}{12} = 150^\circ$ meaning that $\angle FED = \angle DON = 150^\circ$. Since EF = FD = 1 and DO = ON = 1 (just like how AC = CD = 1), then we have that $\triangle ACD \cong \triangle DON \cong \triangle FED$ and because the triangles are isosceles, then AD = DF = FN so D is the circumcenter of $\triangle AFN$. Now, applying the Law of Cosines gets that $AD^2 = 2 + \sqrt{3}$ so the area is $(2 + \sqrt{3})\pi$."

"Compute the number of sets S such that every element of S is a nonnegative integer less than 16, and if $x \in S$ then $(2x \text{ mod } 16) \in S$.","For any nonempty S we must have $0 \in S$. Now if we draw a directed graph of dependencies among the non-zero elements, it creates a balanced binary tree where every leaf has depth 3. We wish to find the number of subsets of nodes such that every node in the set also has its parent in the set. We do this with recursion. Let f(n) denote the number of such sets on a balanced binary tree of depth n. If the root vertex is not in the set, then the set must be empty. Otherwise, we can consider each subtree separately. This gives the recurrence f(n) = f(n − 1)2 + 1. We know f(0) = 2, so we can calculate f(1) = 5, f(2) = 26, f(3) = 677. We add 1 at the end for the empty set. Hence our answer is f(3) + 1 = 678."
"Compute the number of distinct pairs of the form (first three digits of x, first three digits of $x^4$) over all integers $x > 10^{10}$. For example, one such pair is (100, 100) when x = 101010.","Graph these points on an x, y-plane. We claim that there are integers 100 = a0 < a1 < a2 < a3 < a4 = 999, for which the locus of these points is entirely contained in four taxicab (up/right movement by 1 unit) paths from (ai, 100) to (ai+1, 999), i = 0, 1, 2, 3. As we increment x very slowly over all reals in [100, 1000), which would produce the same set of tuples as we want (some small details missing here, but for large enough x we can approximate these decimals to arbitrary precision by scaling by some 10k), it is clear that we must either have only one of the values increasing by 1, or both of them increasing by 1, where increasing by 1 in this context also includes the looping over from 999 to 100. In particular, this looping over occurs at the first three digits of √ powers of 4 between 1 and 10 (i.e. 177, 316, 562), which are precisely the values of a1, a2, a3 that we claimed to exist. Therefore, our taxicab paths have the same total length as one going from (100, 100) up to (999 + 900 + 900 + 900, 999), by stacking our four segments to continue from each other vertically. It remains to compute the number of times both sides of the tuple increased simultaneously, which correspond to fourth powers in the interval (1, 1000). There are four of these corresponding to 24, 34, 44, 54, which are at (199, 159) to (200, 160), (299, 809) to (300, 810), (399, 255) to (400, 256), and (499, 624) to (500, 625). So, our taxicab path is only missing these four holes. Our final count is equal to the total taxidistance of the path, minus 4, and then finally adding back 1 to account for a starting point. 2 · 899 + 3 · 900 − 4 + 1 = 4495."

"How many ways are there to cut a 1 by 1 square into 8 congruent polygonal pieces such that all of the interior angles for each piece are either 45 or 90 degrees? Two ways are considered distinct if they require cutting the square in different locations. In particular, rotations and reflections are considered distinct.","First note that only triangles and quadrilaterals are possible. There are 3 possibilities: • 1/2 by 1/2 right isosceles triangles • 1 by 1/8 rectangles • 1/2 by 1/4 rectangles The first case has 16 possibilities (there are 2 choices for the orientation of each quadrant). The second case has 2 possibilities (either all horizontal or all vertical). The third case is the trickiest. Label the quadrants A, B, C, D where A, B are at the top and B, C are on the left. If each rectangle lies completely within a quadrant, there are 16 ways. If rectangles span quadrants A, B but not C or D, there are 4 ways. Similarly, there are 4 ways each for [rectangles spanning B, C but not D, A], [rectangles spanning C, D but not A, B], and [rectangles spanning D, A but not B, C]. Next, if rectangles span both A, B and C, D, there is 1 way, and if rectangles span both B, C and D, A there is 1 way. Finally there are 2 ways for each adjacent pair of quadrants to have a rectangle spanning them. This brings us to 16 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 36 ways. The final answer is 16 + 2 + 36 = 54."

Compute the sum of the distances from P1 to BC and P2 to BC.","Let T be the foot of the A-altitude of ABC. Recall that BT = 5 and CT = 9. Let T ′ be the foot of the P -altitude of P QR. Since T ′ is the midpoint of the possibilities for P , the answer is (cid:88) d(P, BC) = 2d(T ′, BC). Since T ′ splits QR in a 5 : 9 ratio, we have P d(T ′, BC) = 9d(Q, BC) + 5d(R, BC) 14 . By similar triangles, d(Q, BC) = QB = 12 · 14 an answer of 48. 9 , and similar for d(R, BC), giving d(T ′, BC) = 24, and Solution 2: As in the previous solution, let T be the foot from A to BC, let T ′ be the foot from P to QR. and recall that d(P1, BC) + d(P2, BC) = 2d(T ′, BC). Now, notice that since △P QR ∼ △ABC, we have QT ′ : T ′R = BT : T C, so T T ′ ∥ BQ ∥ CR, implying that A ∈ T T ′. However, we recall a well-known fact that A is the midpoint of T T ′ (can be proven by simple similar triangles). Thus, d(T ′, BC) is equal to two times the altitude from A to BC. Hence, the answer is four times the altitude from A to BC, which is 48."

Then, note that ak+1 − ak = 2023 (cid:88) i=1 |ak+1 − ai| − |ak − ai| = k(ak+1 − ak) − (2023 − k)(ak+1 − ak) = (2k − 2023)(ak+1 − ak). Thus, ak+1 = ak unless k = 1012, so a1 = a2 = · · · = a1012 and a1013 = · · · = a2023, and we can check that that they must be in a ratio of 1011 : 1012. Thus, a1, . . . , a2023 must consist of 1012 copies of 1011c, and 1011 copies of 1012c for some c, so for everything to be a positive integer, we need c ≥ 1.

Compute AD.","Redefine D as the reflection of A across the perpendicular bisector l of BC. We prove that DB and DC are both tangent to ω, and hence the two definitions of D align. Indeed, this follows by symmetry; we have that ∠CBM = ∠CAM = ∠BAM = ∠BCM , so BM = CM and so ω is centered on and hence symmetric across l. Hence reflecting BAC across l, we get that DB, DC are also tangent to ω, as desired. Hence we have by Ptolemy that 5AD = 122 − 82, so thus AD = 16."
Let $ABC$ be an equilateral triangle with side length 2 that is inscribed in a circle $\omega$. A chord of $\omega$ passes through the midpoints of sides $AB$ and $AC$. Compute the length of this chord.,"Let $O$ and $r$ be the center and the circumradius of $\triangle ABC$. Let $T$ be the midpoint of the chord in question. Note that $AO = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$.

By the Pythagorean Theorem, the length of the chord is equal to: $2\sqrt{r^2 - OT^2} = 2\sqrt{\frac{4}{3} - \frac{1}{12}} = 2\sqrt{\frac{5}{4}} = \sqrt{5}$."

Since $y > 0$ we must have $3^x = 2 \implies x = \log_3(2) \implies \frac{1}{x} = \log_2(3)$. This means that $16^{1/x} + 4^{1/x} = (2^{1/x})^4 + (2^{1/x})^2 = 3^4 + 3^2 = 90$."
"Two distinct similar rhombi share a diagonal. The smaller rhombus has area 1, and the larger rhombus has area 9. Compute the side length of the larger rhombus.","Let $d$ be the length of the smaller diagonal of the smaller rhombus. Since the ratio of the areas is 9:1, the ratio of the lengths is 3:1. This means that the smaller diagonal of the larger rhombus (which is also the longer diagonal of the smaller rhombus) has length $3d$. Therefore, the smaller rhombus has diagonal lengths $d$ and $3d$, so since it has area 1, we have $\frac{1}{2}d(3d) = 1 \implies d = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, the side length of the smaller rhombus is $\sqrt{\left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3d}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{5d^2}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}}$. The side length of the larger rhombus is three times this, i.e. $\sqrt{15}$."

So, let’s say a stick’s highest coin value is $a$, and all the other terms have a value of $S$. If $a \ge S + 2$, we cannot build $S + 1$, but we can produce $S$ and $S + 2$, meaning that this cannot happen. So, $a \le S + 1$, and therefore $100 \le S + 1 \to S \ge 99$ giving a lower bound on the answer of 199. This is easily achievable by picking any stick with $S = 99$. For instance, $\{1, 2, 3, 7, 12, 24, 50, 100\}$ is a construction."
"Four people are playing rock-paper-scissors. They each play one of the three options (rock, paper, or scissors) independently at random, with equal probability of each choice.

So, focusing on one such scenario, the desired probability is 12 times the probability that player 1 plays rock and beats everyone else. In this case, player 1 plays rock and all other players must play scissors. All four of these events have probability $\frac{1}{3}$, so this scenario has probability $\frac{1}{81}$. Thus, P(one beats all) = $12 \cdot \frac{1}{81} = \frac{4}{27}$."

Then $\angle P_1OP_8 = 2(180^\circ - \angle P_1P_7P_8) = 4^\circ = \frac{360^\circ}{90}$, which means the arc $[P_1P_8$ that spans 7 sides of the $n$-gon also spans $\frac{1}{90}$ of its circumcircle. Thus $n = 7 \cdot 90 = 630$."
Compute the number of positive four-digit multiples of 11 whose sum of digits (in base ten) is divisible by 11.,"Let an arbitrary such number be $abcd$. Then, we desire $11 | a+b+c+d$ and $11 | a-b+c-d$, where the latter comes from the well-known divisibility trick for 11. Sums and differences of multiples of 11 must also be multiples of 11, so this is equivalent to desiring $11 | a + c$ and $11 | b + d$. As $a \in [1, 9]$ and $b, c, d \in [0, 9]$, $a + c$ and $b + d$ must be either 0 or 11 (no larger multiple is achievable). There are 8 choices for such $(a, c)$ and 9 choices for such $(b, d)$, so the answer is $8 \cdot 9 = 72$."

Now, as $-rs = b$, observe that $202 = r^2 + s^2 = (r + s)^2 - 2rs = 100 + 2b$. This means $b = 51$, so the answer is $10 + 51 = 61$."
"On an $8 \times 8$ chessboard, 6 black rooks and $k$ white rooks are placed on different cells so that each rook only attacks rooks of the opposite color.

For a valid construction, place the black rooks on cells $(a, a)$ for $2 \le a \le 7$ and the white rooks on cells $(a, a + 1)$ and $(a + 1, a)$ for $1 \le a \le 7$. Now, we prove the optimality. As rooks can only attack opposite color rooks, the color of rooks in each row is alternating. The difference between the number of black and white rooks is thus at most the number of rooks. Thus, $k \le 6 + 8 = 14$."

"Compute all ordered triples $(x, y, z)$ of real numbers satisfying the following system of equations: $xy + z = 40$, $xz + y = 51$, $x + y + z = 19$.","By adding the first two equations, we can get $xy + z + xz + y = (x + 1)(y + z) = 91$.

As the quadratic equation can be decomposed into $(t - 7)(t - 13) = 0$, we know that either $x = 6$, $y + z = 13$ or $x = 12$, $y + z = 7$.  If $x = 12$, then $12y + z = 40$, and substituting $y + z = 7$ we have $11y = 33$, $y = 3$ and $z = 4$. If $x = 6$, then $6y + z = 40$, and substituting $y + z = 13$ we have $5y = 27$, $y = 5.4$ and $z = 7.6$. Hence, the two solutions are $(12, 3, 4)$ and $(6, 5.4, 7.6)$."

However, from Vieta, it is $20^2 - 2(108) = 184$, so $100 + 4b = 184$, so $b = 21$. Finally, the product of roots is $(a^2 - (b + \sqrt{c}))(a^2 - (b - \sqrt{c})) = (a^2 - b)^2 - c = 16 - c$, so we have $9 = 16 - c$, so $c = 7$."
"The integers from 1 to 9 are arranged in a 3$\times$3 grid. The rows and columns of the grid correspond to 6 three-digit numbers, reading rows from left to right, and columns from top to bottom. Compute the least possible value of the largest of the 6 numbers.","The 5 cells that make up the top row and left column are all leading digits of the three-digit numbers. Therefore, the largest number has leading digit at least 5, achievable only if 6, 7, 8, and 9 are placed in the bottom right 2$\times$2 square. Then, the only three-digit numbers with tens digit less than 6 are the top row and the left column, so unless 5 is in the top left corner, the three-digit number starting with 5 will be at least 560. Now observe 5 is next to two other digits; if they are not 1 or 2 in some order, then either the top row or left column will read at least 530. Thus we can assume 5 is next to 1 or 2. The next-smallest remaining digit is 3, so the three-digit number starting with 52 must be at least 523. This is achievable as shown below. \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline 2 & 9 & 7 \\ \hline 5 & 1 & 6 \\ \hline 3 & 8 & 4 \\ \hline \end{tabular}"
Compute the sum of all positive integers $x$ such that $\frac{(x-17)\sqrt{x}-1+(x-1)\sqrt{x}+15}{\sqrt{x}}$ is an integer.,"First, we prove the following claim. Claim 1. If integers $a, b, c, d, n$ satisfy $a$ and $c$ are nonzero, $b$ and $d$ are nonnegative, and $a\sqrt{b}+c\sqrt{d} = n$, then either $n = 0$ or both $b$ and $d$ are perfect squares. Proof. We know $a\sqrt{b} = n - c\sqrt{d}$. Squaring both sides, we get $a^2b = (n - c\sqrt{d})^2 = n^2 + c^2d - 2nc\sqrt{d}$, so $2nc\sqrt{d}$ is an integer. If $\sqrt{d}$ is not an integer, then it is not rational, so $2nc\sqrt{d} = 0$. Since $c$ and $\sqrt{d}$ are nonzero, we must have $n = 0$. Similarly, if $\sqrt{b}$ is not an integer, $n = 0$. Thus either $n = 0$ or both $b$ and $d$ are perfect squares. Applying our claim to the given expression, we get three cases. \begin{itemize} \item Case 1: Either $x - 17$ or $x - 1$ is zero. It is easy to verify $x = 1$ is a solution, while $x = 17$ is not. \item Case 2: $(x - 17)\sqrt{x} - 1 + (x - 1)\sqrt{x} + 15 = 0$. Then $(x - 17)^2(x - 1) = (x - 1)^2(x + 15) = 0 \implies (x - 1)(-48x + 304) = 0$. Thus $x = 1$ or $x = \frac{304}{48}$, and the latter isn’t an integer. \item Case 3: $x - 1$ and $x + 15$ are both perfect squares. Let $x + 15 = y^2$ and $x - 1 = z^2$ for nonnegative integers $y$ and $z$. Then, $y^2 - z^2 = (x + 15) - (x - 1) = 16$. Observe that $y + z$ is nonnegative and $y - z \ge 0$, so we have the following cases for $y + z$ and $y - z$: $y + z = 16, y - z = 1 \implies y = 17/2, z = 15/2$; $y + z = 8, y - z = 2 \implies y = 5, z = 3$; $y + z = 4, y - z = 4 \implies y = 4, z = 0$. The only nonnegative integer solutions are $(y, z) = (5, 3)$ or $(y, z) = (4, 0)$, which correspond to $x = 10$ and $x = 1$. Both of these are indeed solutions. Hence, the only $x$ that work are $x = 1$ and $x = 10$, for a total of 11.\end{itemize}"
Rectangle R with area 20 and diagonal of length 7 is translated 2 units in some direction to form a new rectangle R′. The vertices of R and R′ that are not contained in the other rectangle form a convex hexagon. Compute the maximum possible area of this hexagon.,"Dissect the hexagon as shown above, so that it consists of a parallelogram and two triangles which are each half the original rectangle. The parallelogram has side lengths 7 and 2, so its maximum possible area is 14. As the two triangles combined always have the same area as the original rectangle, 20, the answer is 14 + 20 = 34."
"Albert writes down all of the multiples of 9 between 9 and 999, inclusive. Compute the sum of the digits he wrote.","The multiples of 9 from 0 to 999 form 56 such pairs, so the sum of their digits is $56 \cdot 27 = 1512$."
"Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral with area 202, AB = 4, and $\angle A = \angle B = 90^\circ$ such that there is exactly one point E on line CD satisfying $\angle AEB = 90^\circ$. Compute the perimeter of ABCD.","The locus of point E such that $\angle AEB = 90^\circ$ is the circle $\omega$ with diameter AB. Thus, if there exists unique point E, the circle $\omega$ must intersect line CD at exactly one point and hence line CD must be tangent to $\omega$. Now, since $\angle DAB = 90^\circ$, we get that AD is tangent to $\omega$, so DA = DE by equal tangents property. Similarly, CB = CE. Thus, CD = CE + DE = AD + BC. However, equating the given area of the quadrilateral gives $\frac{1}{2}(AD + BC) \cdot AB = 202 \implies AD + BC = 101$. CD + (AD + BC) + AB = 101 + 101 + 4 = 206."
Compute the unique real number $x < 3$ such that $\sqrt{(3-x)(4-x)} + \sqrt{(4-x)(6-x)} + \sqrt{(6-x)(3-x)} = x$.,"Let $a = \sqrt{3-x}$, $b = \sqrt{4-x}$, $c = \sqrt{6-x}$, so $x = ab + bc + ca$. Then $(a+b)(a+c) = 3 - x + 2\sqrt{(3-x)(4-x)} = 3-x + 2a^2 = 3 - x + 2(3-x) = 9-3x$. Likewise, we get that $(a+b)(a+c) = 3 - x + 2\sqrt{(3-x)(4-x)} = 3-x + 2(3-x) = 9-3x$, $(a+b)(b+c) = 4-x + 2\sqrt{(4-x)(6-x)} = 4-x + 2(4-x) = 12-3x$ and $(a+b)(c+a) = 6-x + 2\sqrt{(6-x)(3-x)} = 6-x + 2(6-x) = 18-3x$. By multiplying these equations and taking the square root, we get that $(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = \sqrt{72} = 6\sqrt{2}$, so $a+b = \sqrt{2}$, $b+c = 2\sqrt{2}$ and $c+a = 3\sqrt{2}/2$, and hence $2a = 3\sqrt{2}/2 + \sqrt{2} - 2\sqrt{2} = \sqrt{2}/2 \implies a = \sqrt{2}/4$. Since $a = \sqrt{3-x}$, it follows that $x = \frac{23}{8}$."
"Six consecutive positive integers are written on slips of paper. The slips are then handed out to Ethan, Jacob, and Karthik, such that each of them receives two slips. The product of Ethan’s numbers is 20, and the product of Jacob’s numbers is 24. Compute the product of Karthik’s numbers.","Each person’s numbers differ by at most 5, so Ethan must have 4 and 5. Jacob could have 4 and 6 or 3 and 8. Since Ethan already has 4, Jacob cannot have 4 and 6. So, Jacob has 3 and 8. Then the six numbers must be 3 through 8, so Karthik has 6 and 7, multiplying to 42."
"Let RAN DOM be a regular hexagon with side length 1. Points I and T lie on segments RA and DO, respectively, such that M I = M T and $\angle T M I = 90^\circ$.

"Let ABCD be a trapezoid with AB $\parallel$ CD, AB = 20, CD = 24, and area 880. Compute the area of the triangle formed by the midpoints of AB, AC, and BD.","We first compute the height of the trapezoid. If $h$ is the height, then the area is $880 = \frac{1}{2}h(20 + 24)$, so $h = 40$. Now, let M, N, P be the midpoints of AB, AC, and BD. Notice that PN is parallel to AB. Thus, the altitude from M to NP has length $\frac{h}{2} = 20$. To compute NP, let X be the midpoint of BC. Since XN is a midsegment of $\triangle CAB$, we have $XN = \frac{AB}{2} = 10$. Since XP is a midsegment of $\triangle BCD$, we have $XP = \frac{CD}{2} = 12$. Hence, $NP = 20$. The area of triangle MNP is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 10 \cdot 20 = 100$."

Across all possible placements of P in the plane, compute the sum of all possible answers Mark could get.","If no two vertices have the same x-coordinate, then Mark gets 10. Otherwise, two vertices $P_i$ and $P_j$ have the same x-coordinate. Then $P_k$ and $P_{i+j-k}$ also have the same x-coordinate. The ten vertices pair up into 5 pairs of the form $(P_k, P_{i+j-k})$, so Mark gets 5. If $i + j$ is even, then the vertices pair up into 5 pairs, so Mark gets 6. Thus, the answer is $10 + 5 + 6 = 21$."

Out of these, only the numbers that are not shy are 1234, 2341, 3412, 4123, 5678, 6785, 7856, 8567. Therefore, the answer is $24 + 18 - 8 = 34$."
"Compute the greatest real number $x$ such that $f(f(f(f(f(f(x))))))=0$, where $f(x) = \frac{(x+3)^2}{3}$.","Observe that $f(x) = \frac{(x+3)^2}{3}$. We claim that $f^k(x) = \frac{(x+3)^{2^k}}{3}$ for all positive integers $k$. We use induction. The base case $k=1$ is clear. To show the inductive step, note that $f^k(x) = \frac{(x+3)^{2^k}}{3}$ implies $f^{k+1}(x) = f(f^k(x)) = f\left(\frac{(x+3)^{2^k}}{3}\right) = \frac{\left(\frac{(x+3)^{2^k}}{3} + 3\right)^2}{3} = \frac{(x+3)^{2^{k+1}}}{3}$. Thus, if $r$ is a real root of $f^6$, then $(r+3)^{64} = 3$, so $r+3 = \pm\sqrt[64]{3}$, and hence $r = \pm\sqrt[64]{3} - 3$. The largest value of $r$ is thus $\boxed{\sqrt[64]{3}-3}$."

This implies that $Y$ is the circumcenter of $\triangle AQR$. Thus, $YA = YR = YQ = 2$. We have $\angle AYR = 90^\circ$, so $AR = 2\sqrt{2}$. Moreover, $\angle AYQ = 150^\circ$, so $\angle YAQ = 15^\circ$, which implies that $AQ = 4\sin 75^\circ = \sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}$. By symmetry, we also get that $BR = AQ = \sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}$.

Suppose that $g(a_1, b_1, c_1) = g(a_2, b_2, c_2)$. Then, $\frac{a_1}{\gcd(a_1, b_1, c_1)} = \frac{a_2}{\gcd(a_2, b_2, c_2)} = \dots$. Without loss of generality, assume $a_1 \ge b_1 \ge c_1$, which implies $a_2 \ge b_2 \ge c_2$. Then, $a_1 = \max(a_1, b_1, c_1) = \max(a_2, b_2, c_2) = a_2$, so $b_1 = b_2$ and $c_1 = c_2$ as well. Thus, $g$ is injective. Surjectivity. Now suppose we have a tuple $(a, b, c, m)$ satisfying $\max(a, b, c) \mid m$ and $\gcd(a, b, c) = 1$. Let $d = \frac{m}{\max(a, b, c)}$. Then, $g(da, db, dc) = (a, b, c, m)$. Hence, $g$ is surjective. We conclude $g$ is a bijection between $\{1, \dots, n\}^3$ and tuples $(a, b, c, m)$ satisfying $\max(a, b, c) \mid m$ and $\gcd(a, b, c) = 1$. We have $f(m)$ such tuples for each $m$ by definition, so $\sum_{m=1}^n f(m) = n^3$. Thus, $f(1) + \dots + f(100) = 100^3 = \boxed{1000000}$."

Then $N = \frac{100!}{40!40!20!}$. Let $A$ be the event that all balls before the first green ball are red and all balls after the last green ball are blue. We want to find $P(A) = \frac{|A|}{N}$. The number of arrangements in $A$ is the number of ways to choose the positions of the 20 green balls, which is $\binom{80}{20}$.  For each choice of positions for the green balls, we have to arrange 40 red balls before the first green ball and 40 blue balls after the last green ball. The number of ways to do this is 1.  Therefore, $|A| = \binom{80}{20} = \frac{80!}{20!60!}$. Thus, $P(A) = \frac{\frac{80!}{20!60!}}{\frac{100!}{40!40!20!}} = \frac{80! 40! 40!}{100! 60!} \approx 0.1085859$."
