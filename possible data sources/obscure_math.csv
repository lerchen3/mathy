"Find the largest integer less than 2012 all of whose divisors have at most two 1’s in their binary representations. Call a number good if all of its positive divisors have at most two 1’s in their binary representations. Then, if \(p\) is an odd prime divisor of a good number, \(p\) must be of the form \(2^k + 1\). The only such primes less than 2012 are 3, 5, 17, and 257, so the only possible prime divisors of \(n\) are 2, 3, 5, 17, and 257. Next, note that since \((2^i + 1)(2^j + 1) = 2^{i+j} + 2^i + 2^j + 1\), if either \(i\) or \(j\) is greater than 1, then there will be at least 3 1’s in the binary representation of \((2^i + 1)(2^j + 1)\), so \((2^i + 1)(2^j + 1)\) cannot divide a good number. On the other hand, if \(i = j = 1\), then \((2^1 + 1)(2^1 + 1) = 9 = 2^3 + 1\), so 9 is a good number and can divide a good number. Finally, note that since multiplication by 2 in binary just appends additional 0s, so if \(n\) is a good number, then \(2n\) is also a good number. It therefore follows that any good number less than 2012 must be of the form \(c \cdot 2^k\), where \(c\) belongs to \(\{1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 257\}\) (and moreover, all such numbers are good).

The first case occurs with probability \(\frac{2011!}{2012!} = \frac{1}{2012}\), since any permutation on the remaining 2011 elements is possible. Similarly, for any fixed \(i\), the second case occurs with probability \(\frac{2010!}{2012!} = \frac{1}{2011 \cdot 2012}\), since any permutation on the remaining 2010 elements is possible. Since there are 2011 possible values for \(i\), and since our two possibilities are disjoint, the overall probability that \(\pi(\pi(2012)) = 2012\) equals \(\frac{1}{2012} + \frac{2011}{2011 \cdot 2012} = \frac{1}{1006}\).

Since any proper divisor of \(n\) must be less than or equal to \(n/2\), none of the numbers greater than 1006 can divide any other number less than or equal to 2012. Since there are at most 1006 values of \(n\) for which \(\pi(n) \leq 1006\), this means that there can be at most 1006 values of \(n\) for which \(\pi(n)\) divides \(\pi(n + 1)\). On the other hand, there exists a permutation for which \(\pi(n)\) divides \(\pi(n + 1)\) for exactly 1006 values of \(n\), namely the permutation: \((1, 2, 2^2, 2^3, \ldots, 2^{10}, 3, 2 \cdot 3, 2^2 \cdot 3, 2^3 \cdot 3, \ldots, 2^9 \cdot 3, 5, \ldots)\).

We then concatenate all of these sequences to form a permutation of the numbers 1 through \(\ell\) (note that no number occurs in more than one sequence). It follows that if \(\pi(n) \leq 1006\), then \(\pi(n + 1)\) will equal \(2\pi(n)\), and therefore \(\pi(n)\) will divide \(\pi(n + 1)\) for all 1006 values of \(n\) satisfying \(1 \leq \pi(n) \leq 1006\).

"For integers $0 \leq m, n \leq 64$, let $\alpha(m, n)$ be the number of nonnegative integers $k$ for which $\left\lfloor \frac{m}{2^k} \right\rfloor$ and $\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2^k} \right\rfloor$ are both odd integers. Consider a $65 \times 65$ matrix $M$ whose $(i, j)$th entry (for $1 \leq i, j \leq 65$) is $(-1)^{\alpha(i-1, j-1)}$. Compute the remainder when $\det M$ is divided by 1000.",792
"Given vectors $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ and the string $v_1 v_2 \ldots v_n$, we consider valid expressions formed by inserting $n - 1$ sets of balanced parentheses and $n - 1$ binary products, such that every product is surrounded by a parentheses and is one of the following forms: A ""normal product"" $ab$, which takes a pair of scalars and returns a scalar, or takes a scalar and vector (in any order) and returns a vector. A ""dot product"" $a \cdot b$, which takes in two vectors and returns a scalar. A ""cross product"" $a \times b$, which takes in two vectors and returns a vector. Denote by $T_n$ the number of valid expressions (with $T_1 = 1$), and let $R_n$ denote the remainder when $T_n$ is divided by 4. Compute $R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \ldots + R_{1,000,000}$. If the final answer is a number larger than 1000, take modulo 1000.",300
"Kevin is in first grade, so his teacher asks him to calculate $20 + 1 \cdot 6 + k$, where $k$ is a real number revealed to Kevin. However, since Kevin is rude to his Aunt Sally, he instead calculates $(20+1) \cdot (6+k)$. Surprisingly, Kevin gets the correct answer! Assuming Kevin did his computations correctly, what was his answer?",21
"Yang has a standard 6-sided die, a standard 8-sided die, and a standard 10-sided die. He tosses these three dice simultaneously. The probability that the three numbers that show up form the side lengths of a right triangle can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, for relatively prime positive integers $m$ and $n$. Find $100m + n$.
